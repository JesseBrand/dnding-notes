## Monologue
Exilian struggled with these thoughts while on a boat on the [[Darklake]] with [[The Party]].

_I'm not sure how long we've been adventuring together, but I get the feeling I know some of you better already than most of the young folks that died in my name during what they call the [[Zenith Massacre]].

_I haven't thought of this part of my life in a while, but the lasts days, traveling on this boat, it keeps coming back.. I've spent not days, not weeks, maybe months or years on a boat. Held captive, not knowing if I would ever see anyone again.

_And all because I was trying to stop them fools from summoning those [[Demon|Demons]]. They called me a leader, but it was the only thing I could do. And then this crazy retaliation took place, they hunted us down.. They took every thing... The murdered my fellow Rebellions, they took my wife, my children, my people...
