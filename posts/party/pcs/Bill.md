Bill is a [[Human]] child [[Rogue]] that has joined [[The Party]] on their [[Involvement on the Shard of Tebinor|Involved on the Shard of Tebinor]].

Bill is a peculiar young boy, talking in a high-pitched voice and being way too good with his daggers for a kid his age. Still, Bill has ingrained himself with [[The Party]] and has proven himself a loyal ally that the party is glad to have on board.

Bill rents his own private room in [[Black Barrel Inn]], not sleeping in the common room with most of the others.
