Lynxakasendalor Ghesh, or Ghesh for short, was a Brass [[Dragonborn]] [[Paladin]] of [[Bahamut]] who joined [[The Blue Crusaders]] as they were investigating [[Hera]]'s death in [[Phandalin]]. He joined [[The Party]] on their [[Search for the Forge of Spells]].

While investigating [[Wave Echo Cave]], Ghesh stood his ground as a wave of [[Zombie|Zombies]] threatened to overwhelm the party. Ghesh gave his life for the party, only to be resurrected as a [[Zombie]] himself. After the party dealt with him, [[Thorin]] beheaded him to prevent him from rising again. He was taken outside the cave, where he was cremated alongside [[Orsik]], [[Morthos]] and [[Tharden Rockseeker]].
