Morthos was a [[Tiefling]] [[Rogue]] and part of  [[The Blue Crusaders]].

He joined [[The Party]] as they were travelling to [[Phandalin]] and aided them as they were ambushed by [[Goblin|goblins]] on the road. He accompanied them into a [[Cragmaw Hideout|nearby goblin cave]] then proceeded to accompany them on the [[Search for the Forge of Spells]].

During their incursion into [[Wave Echo Cave]], Morthos scouted ahead and became separated from the party, where he encountered a [[Ochre Jelly]] which consumed him alive. When the party found him, there was no hope for him left.

His body was cremated outside [[Wave Echo Cave]] alongside [[Lynxakasendalor Ghesh|Ghesh]], [[Orsik]] and [[Tharden Rockseeker]].
