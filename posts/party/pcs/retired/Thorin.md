Thorin the [[Dwarf]] [[Barbarian]] was one of the initial [[The Party|party]] members who were recruited by [[Gundren Rockseeker]] to [[Search for the Forge of Spells|find the Forge of Spells]].

Thorin originally studied as a [[Cleric]] of [[Moradin]] in the town of [[Leilon]], but found another purpose in life.

Thorin accompanied the party all the way to the [[Forge of Spells]], but when the party was captured by [[Ilvara Myzzrym]]'s [[Drow Hunting Party]], Thorin was not with the party when they woke up.
