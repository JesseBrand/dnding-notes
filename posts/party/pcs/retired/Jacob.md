Jacob was a [[Human]] [[Warlock]] who apparently worshipped his patron "[[Froggy]]".

He joined [[The Party]] as a fellow prisoner when they were captured and brought to the [[Drow]] stronghold of [[Velkynvelve]].

After [[The Breakout of Velkynvelve]], he followed [[The Party]] on their [[Journey through the Underdark]]. After reaching [[Sloobludop]] and surviving the carnage there, [[The Party]] fled onto the [[Darklake]] on some boats and headed towards [[Gracklstugh]]. However, somewhere along the way they were ambushed to a group of [[Merrow]]. Jacob was pulled overboard and disappeared underwater, not to be seen again.
