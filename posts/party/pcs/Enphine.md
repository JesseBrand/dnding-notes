Enphine was a [[TODO]] [[Elf]] Evocation [[Wizard]].

Enphine has always been interested in finding out how things work. After solving a certain puzzle in an old ruin she found an ancient text that she determined should not fall in the wrong hands. She determined she had to leave her home shard and sought safety on the Front Shard of [[Tebinor]].

Enphine is used to helping out those who she deems less intelligent than she is, and will patiently explain anything and everything to others. She often speaks without really thinking through her words, invariably insulting others. She is however, convinced that people are actively looking for her because of the secrets she carries with her and guards them with her life. She is dedicated to logic and reason and will not let emotion cloud her judgement. She is not very tolerant to others doing so either.

On [[Tebinor]], Enphine found common understanding with the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] of [[Sootwall Observatory]], where she settled down and continued her studies. When money ran short however, started looking into different ventures to earn her some coin. When [[The Party]] stopped by [[Sootwall Observatory|Sootwall]], she seized the opportunity to join them to earn some easy money for her research and magical development, joining them on their [[Involvement on the Shard of Tebinor]].
