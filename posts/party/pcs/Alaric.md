Alaric is an [[Orc|Half-Orc]] [[Barbarian]] and one of the oldest members of [[The Party]] that set out to [[Search for the Forge of Spells|find the Forge of Spells]].

### Backstory
Alaric was born from an act of pure violence and hate and would never truly recover from this. His mother, [[Pandora Silverlight]], was raped during an [[Orc|Orcish]] raid on her hometown of [[Triboar]]. Panic struck when she found out the assault had left her pregnant. However, she had such a love for nature and life that she decided to keep the baby. After the birth of the boy, whom she named Alaric after her [[Alaric Silverlight|grandfather]], the townsfolk learned it was a half-orc and exiled her when she refused to abandon her child. Her father, [[Aiken Silverlight]], was the only one to stand by her.

The family found a small cabin in the woods and lived a relatively happy life. Alaric was taught the nature loving ways of [[Pandora Silverlight|Pandora]], but [[Aiken Silverlight|Aiken]] also taught him to fight with a greataxe, because life in the woods was not without its perils. Without the protection of [[Triboar#The Twelve|The Twelve]], [[Triboar]]'s protectors, the cabin was fair game for the [[Orcish]] Hordes after all. Then, on one fateful day, a [[Bear#Black Bear|Black Bear]] wandered close to the house and murdered both [[Aiken Silverlight|Aiken]] and [[Pandora Silverlight|Pandora]]. Alaric witnessed this and for the first time ever, went into a [[Rage]]. He killed the [[Bear#Black Bear|Black Bear]] then and there. Its skull is on his belt to this day, a reminder that nature can be cruel as well as beautiful but also a token of respect for [[Aiken Silverlight|Aiken]] and [[Pandora Silverlight|Pandora]], his ancestors. Alaric blamed the [[Triboar|Townsfolk]] for what happened: if they had not cast his mother out, [[Aiken Silverlight|Aiken]] and [[Pandora Silverlight|Pandora]] would be alive today. He would never fully trust a [[Human]] ever again. 

After the death of his mother, Alaric decided he would seek out his [[Gortag Crushface|Father]] and kill him for what he had done. Ever since that fateful bear attack, Alaric was sometimes visited by the [[Ancestral Guardian|Spirits]] of his grandfather and his mother, giving him guidance in life. Following their advice, Alaric moved north, towards the mountains near the river [[Surbrin]] where the [[Orcish]] horde that attacked [[Triboar]] came from. Perhaps he could learn more about the identity of his father there. For several years Alaric wandered through the area, seeking out [[Orc|Orcs]], interrogating them, learning their ways. Alaric's life in the wilds came to an end when he finally learned the name of his father: [[Gortag Crushface]]. His whereabouts remained a mystery however... No one knew if his father was even alive.Â 

Alaric decided his life in the wilds would not get him what he needed. He consulted his [[Ancestral Guardian|Ancestors]] and decided to go back to the cabin in the woods, the place where he had been the most content. He would live out his life alone, far away from both [[Human]] and [[Orc]], surrounded by the beauty and the serenity of nature. But that was not to be. When he got back to the cabin he found out it had been ransacked by [[Goblin|Goblins]]! Alaric followed their trail away from the cabin of the Goblins when he heard a noise coming from the nearby cave...

### Involvement
[[TODO]]
A brute with a kind heart, he protected the party well with his greataxe as they descended into [[Wave Echo Cave]], where he was captured by [[Drow]] along with the rest of the party and taken to [[Velkynvelve]].

He helped the party [[The Breakout of Velkynvelve|break out]] and accompanied them on the [[Journey through the Underdark]] where he heard some rumours about his father [[Gortag Crushface]] which he was eager to pursue.

He eventually escaped the [[Blaze of Gracklstugh]] along with the party and escaped the [[Underdark]] to the shard of [[Tebinor]], settling in the town of [[Ebonwatch]].

He became good friends with [[Sam Alderleaf]] as they adventured together, with whom along with [[Castle-8]] he purchased a plot of land in [[Ebonwatch]] where they would have the compound of [[Gryffindork]] built.
