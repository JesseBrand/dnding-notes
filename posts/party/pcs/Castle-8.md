A [[Warforged]] Juggernaut [[Paladin]], Castle-8 was found while [[The Party]] explored [[Wave Echo Cave]] and subsequently activated. After being beaten into submission, Castle-8 joined [[The Party]] on their [[Search for the Forge of Spells]].

After being captured by [[Drow]] alongside [[The Party]], he was taken to [[Velkynvelve]] and after spending more than enough time hanging by his feet, accompanied [[The Party]] on their [[Journey through the Underdark]].

He escaped the [[Underdark]] to the shard of [[Tebinor]] and has been spending his time in and around the town of [[Ebonwatch]] since.

After [[Session 3-2 - What's in a Name|Losing his Name]] to the [[Blue Lady]], he was temporarily addressed as "Horny-1".

Together with [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Alaric]], he has founded the compound of [[Gryffindork]].
