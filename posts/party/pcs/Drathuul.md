Drathuul was a Blue [[Dragonborn]] [[Fighter]] / [[Sorcerer]] who travelled with [[The Party]] for a while.

[[The Party]] ran into Drathuul in [[The Shattered Spire]] in [[Gracklstugh]]. After learning of their intentions, he tagged along.

He was greatly impressed by [[Themberchaud]] the Red [[Dragon]] and vowed to help him recover his lost egg.

After exploring the [[Whorlstone Tunnels]], he was able to locate the egg along with [[The Party]], which hatched into a Red [[Dragon]] Wyrmling they named [[Firestarter]], who instantly bonded with Drathuul.

After leaving the tunnels, they found the city overwhelmed by [[Madness]]. Drathuul helped quell the riots and convinced [[Themberchaud]] of the intentions of the [[Keepers of the Flame]] to replace him. [[Themberchaud]] was enraged and proceeded to [[Blaze of Gracklstugh|Burn Down the City of Gracklstugh]].

After fleeing the city, he and the rest of [[The Party]] escaped the [[Underdark]] and ended up in the shard of [[Tebinor]], finding a new home in the town of [[Ebonwatch]].

He assisted [[The Party]] on several adventures before meeting the [[Dragon|Dragons]] [[Essephy]] and [[Nivrath]] in [[Gamwater Quarry]]. When descending into the darkness below, they faced a [[Shadow Beholder]] they were able to slay, but Drathuul was instantly killed by a Death Ray did not live to tell the tale.

Drathuul's body was brought back to [[Nivrath]] and [[Essephy]], who offered to lay his essence to rest, which [[The Party]] agreed to.
