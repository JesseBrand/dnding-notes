Hemeth was a [[Duergar]] who was a temporary travelling companion of [[The Party]].

He was rescued by [[The Party]] from the [[Kuo-Toa]] in [[Sloobludop]], who wished to sacrifice him to [[Demogorgon]], then led them accross the [[Darklake]] to the [[Duergar]] City of [[Gracklstugh]].

Once there, he introduced the party to his main contact there, [[Navani]]. He did not make it out of the [[Whorlstone Tunnels]] when they exploded shortly before the party fled the city during the [[Blaze of Gracklstugh]].
