The Rockseeker Brothers are named [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]], [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] and [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]]. They devoted their lives to finding the lost mines of [[Phandelver]] and the fabled [[Forge of Spells]] supposedly located within. After finding clues to its location, they moved towards the small town of [[Phandalin]] in the [[Sword Coast]] and started to look for more information.

When they discovered its location within [[Wave Echo Cave]], [[Gundren Rockseeker]] left for [[Neverwinter]] to recruit adventurers to aid them in their undertaking while [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] and [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] carefully investigated the cave.

[[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] succesfully recruited [[Thorin]], [[John]], [[Hera]] and [[Therai]] and led them in the [[Search for the Forge of Spells]].

[[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] was killed entering [[Wave Echo Cave]], while [[Nundro Rockseeker]] became stuck and was eventually rescued by [[The Party]].
