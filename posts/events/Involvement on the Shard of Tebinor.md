aliases: Events on the Shard of Tebinor, Involved on the Shard of Tebinor
---
After arriving on the shard of Tebinor, [[The Party]] quickly found themselves involved in its internal affairs.

As they narrowly escaped a [[Demon Armies|horde of Demons]] led by [[Yeenoghu]] in the [[Underdark]] they escaped through a [[Portal between Tebinor and the Underdark|portal]] that was opened by [[Grazillax]].

As they proceeded in daylight for the first time in a long time, they encountered some soldiers from the [[Vaviel Empire]] that had dealt with a [[Giant]] and were somewhat surprised to see them. They took them back to the town of [[Ebonwatch]] where they found a tavern and a safe haven for the first time in a very long while.
