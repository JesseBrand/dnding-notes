[[The Party]] travelled through the [[Underdark]] looking for a way out after having been captured by [[Ilvara Myzzrym]] and her [[Drow]] associates.

The party was captured in [[Wave Echo Cave]] after finding the [[Forge of Spells]].

They were taken to the [[Drow]] stronghold of [[Velkynvelve]] where several new members joined party, mainly [[Exilian]], [[Jacob]] and [[Buttercup]], along with some companions: [[Derendil]], [[Buppido]], [[Shuushar the Awakened]], [[Ront]] , [[Stool]] , [[Eldeth Feldrun]], [[Jimjar]], [[Topsy]] and [[Turvy]].

They orchestrated a breakout, in which [[Salazar]], [[Turvy]] and [[Jimjar]] died. [[Ront]] and [[Eldeth Feldrun|Eldeth]] also did not survive the aftermath. [[Topsy]] stayed behind.

The party travelled through the [[Underdark]] while pursued by [[Ilvara Myzzrym]]'s [[Drow Hunting Party]]. They reached the [[Silken Paths]], a huge spiderweb, and were aided by two goblins named [[Yuk-Yuk]] and [[Spiderbait]] to navigate through the webs. After dealing with many dangers and [[Giant Spider|Giant Spiders]] they reached the end of the webs, losing [[Stool]] to friendly fire along the way.

They continued their journey and took to infighting as nightly events started to unfold. Eventually [[Derendil]] was found dead in a puddle of blood, with several party members pointing at eachother, but no culprit was found.

Their journey took them to [[Sloobludop]], a [[Kuo-Toa]] town on the edge of the [[Darklake]], where [[Shuushar the Awakened|Shuushar]] suggested they would find safe haven. However, they landed right in the middle of a religious schism which led to the summoning of [[Demogorgon]] from the depths of the [[Darklake]]. [[Shuushar the Awakened|Shuushar]] went mad and the rest of [[The Party]] was able to escape onto the [[Darklake]] in two boats, freeing a [[Duergar]] named [[Hemeth]].

They crossed the [[Darklake]] to [[Gracklstugh]], a [[Duergar]] city. During the travel, they were beset by several aquatic and flying creatures. [[Jacob]] was drawn under by a [[Merrow]] and was lost at sea.

They reached [[Gracklstugh]] and approached the dockside quietly. They noticed [[Drow]] watching them as [[Hemeth]] introduced them to [[Navani]]. [[Buppido]] snuck away from the party. They also met [[Drathuul]] in the tavern, who joined them as well. It became clear to them that [[Demon Armies]] were now roaming several areas of the [[Underdark]].

The party faced a two-headed Stone [[Giant]] in the city, then were taken to the commander of the [[Stone Guard]], [[Errde Blackskull]]. She shared her concerns on spreading [[Madness]] in the city and asked the party to help by finding a rogue [[Derro]] named [[Droki]] in the [[Whorlstone Tunnels]] beneath the city.

The party met [[Themberchaud]], the guardian Red [[Dragon]] of the city, and were asked to recover its lost [[Firestarter|Egg]]. They headed to the [[Whorlstone Tunnels]] but encountered and incited a [[Derro]] riot along the way.

Within the tunnels they faced several mad [[Derro]] along with [[Buppido]], who had apparently manifested himself as a [[God of Madness]]. They dealt with him, had [[Rumpadump]] join them and fully explored the tunnels. After a long chase they were able to catch up with [[Droki]] and eliminated him, but were none the wiser.

They eventually found the dragon egg and through sheer stupidity were able to hatch it, giving birth to a Red [[Dragon]] wyrmling they named [[Firestarter]] who was adopted by the party.

They left the [[Whorlstone Tunnels]] through another secret exit, but as they did the cavern beneath them started blowing up. [[Teezee]], [[Buttercup]] and [[Hemeth]] did not make it out of the tunnels.

The party emerged in the middle of a riot. [[Madness|Mad]] [[Duergar]] and [[Derro]] were fighting the [[Stone Guard]]. As they made their way through the city, they encountered [[Nuk]], who they joined forces with. They made their way to [[Themberchaud]]'s lair, where they delivered [[Firestarter]] and told him about the [[Keepers of the Flame]]'s plan to replace him with the young wyrmling. After hearing this, [[Themberchaud]] proceeded to [[Blaze of Gracklstugh|burn down the city of Gracklstugh]].

The party fled the city, aided by the inferno. They travelled several days through the [[Underdark]] and encountered [[Grazillax]], who warned them of a horde of [[Gnoll|gnolls]] nearby. They aided him in opening a [[Portal between Tebinor and the Underdark|portal]] out of the [[Underdark]] before being overrun by [[Gnoll|gnolls]] under the command of [[Yeenoghu]] and unknowingly ended up on the shard of [[Tebinor]].
