aliases: Unicorns

A [[Race]] of horse-like [[Celestial]] being of good, Unicorns are powerful being that enforce good rigorously. Their horns are prices for the use in the creation of powerful [[Magic Items]] and [[Alchemy]], but no-one in their right mind would be so evil to slay a unicorn merely to obtain their horns.

Some notable Unicorns in this Campaign:
- When [[The Blue Crusaders]] ventured into [[Thundertree]], [[Teezee]] was influenced by a bout of [[Wild Magic]] and summoned a Unicorn. [[Morthos]] subsequently started a fight it with, which almost ended badly for the party.
- During their [[Journey through the Underdark]], [[Teezee]] once again summoned a Unicorn through his [[Wild Magic]] while crossing the [[Silken Paths]]. After once again agitating it, [[Buttercup]] launched it into the Abyss using a Thunderwave, taking [[Stool]] with it.
