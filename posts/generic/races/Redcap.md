A [[Race]] of angry, crazed gnomes with some similarity to [[Gnome|Gnomes]], these magical [[Fey]] creatures are usually only found in the [[Feywild]].

Redcap can charge and tackle their opponents, as well as face off with them using their enormous sickles, making them very dangerous in close combat.

Some notable Redcaps in this Campaign:
* Many Redcaps are employed by the [[Blue Lady]] in the [[Realm of the Blue Lady]].
