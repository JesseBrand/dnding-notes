Giants are a [[Race]] of huge humanoid creatures of varying intelligence and ability.

Giants are divided into different casts according to [[The Ordning]], their belief system. Among True Giants, they are divided in Hill Giants, Stone Giants, Frost Giants, Fire Giants and Cloud Giants

### Hill Giants
Hill Giants are little more than dumb brutes, using the size to bully others.

Some notable Hill Giants in this Campaign:
* In [[Session 3-2 - What's in a Name|Furdas 1 514]] [[The Party]] tracked the trails of a Hill Giant to the [[Hornwood Stream]] and into the [[Royal Woodlands]]. They found the Giant sleeping, but when approaching him were teleported to the [[Realm of the Blue Lady]].

### Stone Giants
Some notable Stone Giants in this Campaign:
* There was an enclave of Stone Giants in [[Gracklstugh]] in the [[Underdark]], which [[The Party]] did not visit.
* A Two-Headed [[Madness|Mad]] Stone Giant wreaked havoc in the [[Darklake Docks]] in [[Gracklstugh]] but was taken down by [[The Party]].

### Frost Giants
Some notable Frost Giants in this Campaign:

### Fire Giants
Some notable Fire Giants in this Campaign:
* When [[The Party]] first set foot on [[Tebinor]] in [[Session 2-28 - Overrun|Tridas 3 514]] they encountered a patrol of [[Vavian Soldiers]] that had apparently just slain a Fire Giant in the [[The Black Crevice]].
