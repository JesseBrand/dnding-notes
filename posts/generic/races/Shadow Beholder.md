aliases: Shadow Beholders

Shadow Beholders are a type of [[Beholder]] that thrive on [[Darkness]] and are able to use it to their full advantage. These [[Abberation|Abberations]] are utterly alien in nature and do not occur naturally in the [[Shards]].

A Shadow Beholder was encountered by [[The Party]] in the tunnels beneath [[Gamwater Quarry]] on [[Session 3-10 - Quarrelsome Quarry|Sidas 1 514]]. After they met the [[Dragon|Dragons]] [[Nivrath]] and [[Essephy]], they told the party of a [[Shadow Rift]] in the tunnels beneath their lair. It became clear they were afraid of it and what apparently was coming out. [[The Party]] investigated and found the [[Shadow Rift|Rift]], but were attacked by the Beholder, hidden in a sphere of [[Darkness]]. They were able to kill it, but lost [[Drathuul]] to it.

No other reports of Shadow Beholders have been made.
