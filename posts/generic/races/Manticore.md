Manticores are a [[Race]] of [[Monstrosity|Monstrosities]] apparently made up of several different creatures. They were created through magic sometime in the past, but have proven very difficult to control.

They have the body of a [[Lion]], the leathery wings of a [[Dragon]] and a somewhat [[Human|Humanoid]] face. Their long tails are filled with spikes which they can launch at their enemies from great distances, while staying afloat in the air, out of reach of melee weaponry.

A set of [[Manticore Nests]] was discovered in the [[Smithwrath Mountains]] not far from [[Sootwall Observatory]]. When the Manticores became a threat to the [[Sootwall Observatory|Observatory]], the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] enlisted [[The Party]] to deal with the Manticores in , who did so successfully. They slew many Manticores, including two [[Manticore Elder|Manticore Elders]] and brought quite a few eggs back to [[Ebonwatch]] with them.
