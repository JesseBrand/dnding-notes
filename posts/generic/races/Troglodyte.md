A [[Race]] of subterranean amphibian humanoids, generally of low intelligence and quite aggressive. They tend to keep to themselves unless challenged in their lairs.

Some notable Troglodytes in this Campaign:
* A tribe of Troglodytes took refuge in [[Anorak Iron Mine]] and got into a confrontation with the miners and a local tribe of [[Lizardfolk]]. Apparently they have a lair nearby.
