Giant Termites were encountered at the [[Termite Mound]] in the [[Royal Woodlands]] near the [[Grassroads]].

While not much of a threat individually, they appeared in large numbers and possessed the ability to quickly degrade the armor of the creatures they attacked, making them more of a threat than they would seem.
