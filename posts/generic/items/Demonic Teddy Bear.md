Three Sentient Teddy Bears, identified as [[Avatar of Slaughter|Avatars of Slaughter]], possessed by a [[Demon|Demonic]] essence were obtained by [[The Party]] during [[Session 3-25 - Bulls on Parade|Nendas 4 514]] after slaying three [[Avatar of Slaughter|Avatars of Slaughter]]. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] noticed something could be done with the slain foes, after which [[Aboouck]] offered some stuffed animals to try it out with, resulting in the essences being bound to three separate possessed Teddy Bears.

Afterwards, the essences were transformed from the Teddy Bears into several items.

The three [[Avatar of Slaughter]] are now in the following forms:
- [[Paxton's Chest Teddy Bear Avatar]]
- [[Armblade Teddy Bear Avatar]]
- [[Crystal Teddy Bear Avatar]]
