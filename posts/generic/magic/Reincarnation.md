Reincarnation is a magical [[Druid]] ability where the soul of a deceased person is transferred to a newly created body. This body may very well be of a different [[Race]] than the reincarnated person originally was.

Notable Reincarnations in this campaign:
* [[Sam Alderleaf]] was reincarnated by [[Reidoth]] the [[Druid]] in the village of [[Thundertree]] after being slain by [[Venomfang]] the Green [[Dragon]].
