Gust of Wind is a [[Spells#2nd Level|2nd Level Spell]] that acts as an upgraded version of the [[Gust]] [[Spells#Cantrips|Cantrip]]. It creates a tunnel of wind that the Spellcaster needs to [[Concentration|Concentrate]] on. Doing so, they are able to change the direction of the heavy winds. A creature caught in the wind tunnel has a very hard time keeping to their feet, let alone overcome the heavy winds and move into them.
