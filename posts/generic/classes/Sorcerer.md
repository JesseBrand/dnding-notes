Sorcerers gain their magic powers from their bloodline. They are infused by magic through their ancestry and know a small amount of spells, but can project them in very versatile ways.

Some sorcerers are subject to [[Wild Magic]], which causes chaos around them when they attempt to cast spells.

Some notable Sorcerers in this Campaign:
* [[Therai]]
* [[Teezee]]
* [[Salazar]]
* [[Drathuul]]
* [[Nuk]]
* [[Aboouck]]
