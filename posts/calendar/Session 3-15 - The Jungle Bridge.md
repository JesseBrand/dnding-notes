- met up in the the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] when [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] reported on their meeting with the [[Duke Oakfire|Duke]], about [[Demon Armies|Demons]] overrunning the [[Tebinor|Shard]] and that they could all be in real trouble being outnumbered, recommending the [[The Party|Party]] members focus their activities on preparing against this invasion;
- were disturbed by a rumble and shouting [[Vavian Soldiers|Guards]] outside the tavern, having [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Enphine]], [[Horatio]] and [[Alaric]] go outside to check it out;
- noticed a [[Ru Eir Hydrus|creature/person]] outside of the gate with a [[Ru's Mask|Mask]] on, claiming he is unable to remove it, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] vaguely recognising the voice and asking him about it, then being recognised himself for his involvement on [[Asholas]] along with [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]];
- had the creature identify himself as [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] after which [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] remembers him, but the [[Vavian Soldiers|Guards]] still refusing to stand down, they mentioned someone like [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] would have to issue such a command;
- had [[Horatio]] cast [[Vortex Warp]] on [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] and teleport him into the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]], leaving the [[Vavian Soldiers|Guards]] startled and reaching for their weapons, but giving up quickly;
- were approached by another stranger introducing himself to the 4 adventures at the gate as [[Girard de Kosigan]], a holy [[Cleric|Priest]] from the newly built [[Ebonwatch Church|Church]] just outside [[Ebonwatch]];
- got to know [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] who mentioned he was looking for adventures and indicated he thought the party needed a healer and that he could supply this added value;
- reconvened in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] and spoke with [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] and [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]], who mentioned he was from the Shard of [[Addiarus]] and gave a round of [[Boatliver Ale|Boatliver]] to the entire [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]];
- made plans where to go next, mentioned the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] as [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] claimed he could cast [[Daylight]] which would help in the fight with the [[Shadow]] monsters;
- listened to [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] mention that a way to communicate with [[Tuletus]] so that they could call for [[Vavian Soldiers|Reinforcements]] would be of great value but might take a while, so the sooner they started on it the greater the chance that reinforcements would arrive on time;
- decided to attempt to recover the escaped [[Runaway Slaves]] to find a way to communicate with other shards, then left for [[Hornwood]] and decided to show off their abilities on ways to cross the [[Hornwood Stream|River]], [[Exilian]] getting in a lot of trouble before realizing he could put his ring on;
- headed towards [[Sir Dozak's Forward Camp]] quietly and explained to [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] they were looking for slaves, having [[Lambert]] join them to show them where they were spotted;
- headed further into the [[Royal Woodlands|Woods]] and came across the sleeping [[Giant]] some of them [[Session 3-2 - What's in a Name|Eencountered Before]], but decided to avoid it for now;
- noticed the [[Royal Woodlands|Woods]] turn into a more dense jungle which became increasingly more difficult to move through, then found a hilltop which Sam scouted out, noticing a [[Grassroads|Very Long Bridge]] through the canopy;
- left [[Lambert]] behind and climbed the hill, then embarked upon the [[Grassroads|Bridge]] which seemed to stretch on for a long while, crossing carefully;
- noticed a [[Cricketmen|cricket-like creature]] run towards them as two [[Griffon|Griffons]] were in pursuit, hunting it, then came to its rescue;
- saw the [[Griffon|Griffons]] take down the cricket, then saw [[Alaric]] grab his new [[Greataxe]] and slash down a [[Griffon]] nearly in one swing before finishing the other one which was already heavily damaged by [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] as well;
- had [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] patch up the [[Cricketmen|Cricketman]] again, which was very thankful but impossible to understand until [[Exilian]] cast [[Comprehend Languages]] and had some tough communication;
- accepted a few portions of jerky as thanks from the [[Cricketmen|Cricketman]] and received a sack with 3 dried beans and a large 2-headed trident weapon called a [[Githka]] as a sign of thanks from it;
- tried their best to ask the [[Cricketmen|Cricketman]] for directions but only got as far as being directed further onto the bridge, mentioning a [[Termite Mound]];
- noticed a huge [[Stone Archway]] far, far off to the north, well beyond their reach for now, then reached the end of the [[Grassroads|Bridge]], still in the jungle, then noticed a large stone mound nearby;
- approached the [[Termite Mound|Mound]], noticing some large [[Giant Anteater|Anteater-Like Creatures]] which they identified as fiends, but who apparently were not hostile to them and which they after careful collaboration decided to ignore;
- continued towards the entrance of the [[Termite Mound]] then noticed the ground shaking as many [[Giant Termite]] approached from underground, engaging [[The Party]];
- were attacked by the [[Giant Termite|Termites]] that damaged [[Castle-8]] and [[Alaric]]'s armor, then saw [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] drop a horn of [[Gunpowder]] into one of the passageways which blew a large part of the [[Termite Mound|Mound]] apart and killed several [[Giant Termite|Termites]];
- had [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] cast [[Spirit Guardians]], creating a sphere of little [[Celestial]] warriors to protect the party, inspiring [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] to do the same but who summoned more demonic [[Spirit Guardians|Spirits]], which made short work of the remaining [[Giant Termite|Termites]];
- had [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] send out his [[Bat]] [[Familiar]] to investigate the cavern who lost the connection with the [[Bat]] about 50 foot in;
- looked around the place to investigate if the [[Runaway Slaves]] had come past it, and noticed trails leading into the [[Termite Mound|Mound]];
- had Sir Dixon activate [[Detect Magic]] and noticed there was a magic barrier inside the cave, then headed back to [[Ebonwatch]] to return another day;
