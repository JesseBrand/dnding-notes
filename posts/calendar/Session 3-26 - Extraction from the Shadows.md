## Nude Shiny Training Rabbit
Throughout the last week strange events had happened within [[Ebonwatch]], mostly focused around one little rabbit called [[Aboouck|Aboouck]], who was focusing on his training. Spread out over the days the following events happened:
1. He shad his fur within the blink of an eye, which slowly started growing back over the subsequent days;
2. He was nowhere to be found for a full day;
3. A group of small fluffy creatures caused a lot of ruckus in the market square;
4. He started turning into a sheep, but could halt the transformation before it took hold;
5. He randomly teleported all over the town;
6. He aged significantly;
7. He grew an extra eye;
8. He started glowing brightly, which seemed to last for a longer time;
9. Faint Ethereal music could be heard around [[Aboouck]].
Although it made an impact on the [[Ebonwatch|Town]], it wasn't the first time they had seen [[Aboouck|Aboouck]] do strange things on the training grounds.
## Reinforced Stool
During the week [[Nuk|Nuk]] broke a stool due to the fact that he had gained significant weight due to all his stress eating. [[Florellius Patar|Florellius]] was forced to reinforce the stool [[Nuk|Nuk]] was sitting on as he had become a trusted source of income by now. The question remained as to how long it would take for [[Nuk|Nuk]] to eat the [[Ebonwatch|Town]] supply of food, which was already dwindling since the [[Portal between Tebinor and Tuletus|Portal]] was closed. When asked why [[Nuk]] was eating so much he replied that he was stress eating due to all the demons living on [[Tebinor|The Shard]].
## What Happened to the Grumpy Old Man
[[Enphine|Enphine]] and [[Bill|Bill]] walked into the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]], but [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] wasn't among them. When [[Bill]] was asked where [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was, he replied: It's not going well with him, he seems to grow weaker and weaker. This worried the party for a short amount of time before they decided to move on.

[[Castle-8]] also indicated he had been to the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]], which had been overwhelmed by a large [[Shadow]] blanket. He also told the party he had spotted a large blue ball moving around on the lowers floors, covered by [[Shadow]].
## The 3 Stooges
[[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] walked in, having seemingly grown a bulge on his chest, which started to talk, complaining about being stuck in a wrong form. There were more voices coming from his backpack, claiming they needed a better form as well. This attracted a lot of attention. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] explained that the presence put into the [[Demonic Teddy Bear|Demonic Teddy Bears]] recovered last time were [[Avatar of Slaughter|Avatars of Slaughter]]. The [[Demonic Teddy Bear|Teddy Bears]] were begging to be transferred into a different form to which [[Castle-8|Castle-8]] replied that they could transfer to his [[Armblade]]. He extended his sword and offered it. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] took out on of the [[Demonic Teddy Bear|Teddy Bears]], and it jumped straight towards [[Castle-8|Castle-8]]'s [[Armblade]], binding with it. [[Enphine|Enphine]] [[Identify|Identified]] the effect that had transpired. The [[Demonic Teddy Bear|Teddy Bear]] seemed to empower [[Castle-8|Castle-8]]'s [[Armblade]] by a lot, making it hit swifter and harder. After discovering the powers she asked if they had any use for her fire [[Spells]], to which the other teddy bear replied "Yes! I like fire! I like you!", the [[Demonic Teddy Bear|Teddy Bear]] merged with her crystal focus and curled up into a little ball, [[Identify|Identifying]] that showed it will dramatically increase [[Enphine|Enphine]]'s ability related to fire. Lastly [[Enphine|Enphine]] identified the last [[Demonic Teddy Bear|Teddy Bear]] which was lodged into [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s chest. This one seemed to have lost its power, although [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] mentioned that he had the heightened ability to know exactly what was happening around him at all times.
## Loud Tiny Bird
Through an open window a very tiny owl flew in. It landed on the table in front of [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], and started shouting that he wanted to join [[The Party]], as he understood that they were the group hunting for [[Troll|Trolls]], to which [[Chamberlain Gerrard|Chamberlain]] happy replied that the problem was already dealt with and the bounty was removed since there were no more [[Troll|Trolls]] around the [[Arken Fissure|Fissure]] anymore as the area was overrun. [[Bill|Bill]] asked the little owl who he was, to which the owl replied "[[Layden Fantail]]", [[Bill|Bill]] also wondered what he had to offer. [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] said he was very good with music and demonstrated a lullaby which caused one of the waitresses and two of the guards to fall asleep. [[Eve]] the waitress hit her head on the way down and was bleeding heavily, as well as dropping her tray of drinks, making a mess of the tavern floor. The remaining guards were alerted and sprung into action immediately. [[Sir Darion]] wanted to know why the little owl did this and started asking questions. [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] tried to respond but was unable to speak, suddenly being overcome with a [[Silence]] Spell. The Guards grew more frustrating by the disobedience and wanted to throw [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] in jail, who noticed after a short while that [[Silence]] was cast, and he flew out to explain what had happened. The Guards gave it a rest and [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] healed up [[Eve]]. [[Florellius Patar|Florellius]] demanded that the shattered glass be repaid and demanded 3 gold. [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] tried to talk his way out but [[Aboouck|Aboouck]] decided paid for the bill, indicating [[Horatio]] would handle his finances. A little cockfight started between [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] which carried on most of the day.
## Shrouded Entrance
[[The Party]] decided they should revisit [[Gamwater Quarry]]. A lot of discussions and pecking happened during the long walk there.

When they arrived they saw that the shroud of [[Darkness]] had spread even further up, covering the entire lower floors of the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] up to the rim. [[Castle-8|Castle-8]] moved ahead with [[Daylight]] cast on his horn. As he entered the shroud, the [[Demonic Teddy Bear|Teddy Bear]] embedded in his [[Armblade]] spoke up and shouted he should not enter, but of course he did. [[Castle-8]] was surprised by a legion of [[Shadow|Shadows]] that started attacking him. They overwhelmed him so much that he used his [[Misty Step]] to get away and opened up the attack on the people behind him, allowing the [[Shadow|Shadows]] to shift their focus to [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], who seemed to attract them in some sense.

[[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] used a magical [[Shield]] several times to fend off incoming attacks. [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] created an [[Emboldening Bond]], then [[Bless|Blessed]] a bunch of party members. [[Aboouck|Aboouck]] enlarged [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] as [[Enphine|Enphine]] launched a [[Fireball]], clearing a significant area of [[Shadow|Shadows]]. Seeing their success, the party decided to push forward. [[Castle-8|Castle-8]] gathered his courage and rejoined the fight.
## Another Huge Shadow Monster
[[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] noticed another huge [[Shadow Monster]] approaching and alerted [[The Party]] to it. Given directions by [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] dropped a [[Horn of Gunpowder]] on top of it, which cleared some [[Shadow]] but did not seem to hurt the big monstrosity that much.

[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] scouted in the shroud of [[Darkness]] for the blue ball [[Castle-8]] had mentioned before, based on directions from [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]. [[Aboouck]] cast [[Haste]] on [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]]. This did not last long however, leaving [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] hanging lethargic just above the shroud. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] setup [[Spirit Guardians]] which kept the [[Shadow|Shadows]] at bay but also removed the shroud of [[Darkness]] wherever he went; [[Castle-8]] cast [[Crusader's Mantle]] aura which benefited the party in fighting [[Shadow|Shadows]].

[[Enphine]] set up a [[Wall of Fire]] at the edge of the walkway, preventing more [[Shadow|Shadows]] from joining the fight. [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] hypnotised a part of the enemy horde, leaving them stranded.

When [[Enphine]]'s [[Wall of Fire]] failed, she set up an area of [[Sickening Radiance]], greatly hurting the [[Shadow|Shadows]]. [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] used a bunch of [[Silvery Barbs]] to help out [[Castle-8|Castle-8]] and sang several songs about [[Castle-8|Castle-8]], inspiring him. [[Castle-8|Castle-8]] started using his [[Armblade]] to slash away with immense power, hitting so powerful he had trouble holding it together, [[Exhaustion|Exhausting]] him in the process as the [[Demonic Teddy Bear|Teddy Bear]] kept encouraging him to continue. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] nearly died by the [[Shadow Monster]]'s abilities, but was saved by a [[Death Ward]] he had cast himself. [[Bill]] jumped around stabbing everything he could see, while warding off a whole lot of [[Shadow|Shadows]] flying up the cliffside. [[Aboouck|Aboouck]] cast several spells, his magic spilling everywhere, creating a third eye on his forehead (just like last week), allowing him to perform extra actions, and felt death touching him as the [[Shadow Monster]] focused on him.
## Extraction and Retreat (Plan D)
[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] called out to [[Aboouck|Aboouck]] to [[Enlarge]] him so he could [[Fly]] into the [[Darkness]] to pick up the blue ball, which he had now identified as a [[Blue Dragon Egg|Dragon Egg]]. [[Aboouck]] immediately dropped the [[Enlarge]] when [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]]'s head peaked out the top of the shroud in order to save [[Castle-8|Castle-8]] and frankly also the rest of [[The Party|The party]] by turning [[Castle-8|Castle-8]] into a [[Giant Ape]]. The end result was that [[The Party]] managed to kill almost all of the little and medium [[Shadow|Shadows]] that had emerge from the shroud, except for the large [[Shadow Monster]]. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] however noticed many more [[Shadow|Shadows]] and [[Shadow Monster|Shadow Monsters]] approaching, prompting their escape with the egg and their lives.
