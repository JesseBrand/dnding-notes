## Gambling Consequences
[[The Party]] had noticed that [[Bill]] was sitting at the table with a several guards, and they were playing a die game. Something that was very noticeable was the stack of gold that [[Bill]] had collected on his side of the table, but also that there was a guard sobbing a table down without his armor.

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was observing how [[Bill]] was playing but was so dazzled by the pain from the forest that he did not notice how [[Bill]] was winning every single die throw. [[Alaric]] joined the table to cheer [[Bill]] on. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] cast [[Detect Magic]] to advice [[Bill]] on his next playmate, figuring out who to relieve of his magic items.
## Beer brewed by... [[Exilian]]?
[[Enphine]] entered, followed by [[Exilian]] carrying a gigantic sack filled to the brim with some form of liquid. [[Exilian]] explained that this was beer that sprouted from a magic bean he had planted. [[Alaric]]  rushed forward to drink all the beer, but not before [[Enphine]] could fill a water skin with the beer so she could identify it to see what it was made off and how [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] could maybe  recreate it. The beer seemed to be quite tasty.
## Debt Collectors
A group of guards entered the inn together with [[Sir Ginimus]], who announced to the guard without armor on that he was deep in debt and according to [[Vavia|Vavian]] Law he had 1 week to settle his debts to a maximum of 5 platinum in debt. If he would not manage this he would be put into slavery. He then moved on towards [[Aboouck]] and told him the same message. [[Aboouck]] was flabbergasted on how this could happen, he thought [[Florellius Patar|Florellius]] would take care of his finances, but it turned out that [[Florellius Patar|Florellius]] was the one who reported his debt, again according to law.
[[Horatio]] stepped in and pay off the debts of everyone of [[The Party]] in one go, costing him a sum of 295 gold.
Hearing the penalty of being indebted to the empire [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] decided to pay off the guards' debt as well, up till the maximum allowed and gave him fitting advice not to gamble more than he could carry.
## [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]?? But how ?
As [[Sir Ginimus]] left, a figure squeezed by him into the tavern. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] entered, even though everyone was certain he had passed away. [[Nuk]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] both did not believe their eyes and started to investigate from a distance but couldn't find anything out of the ordinary. Many questions were asked to [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] how this was possible.

He explained he had awakened in the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] and made his way out. [[Castle-8]] tried to contact the dragons in the quarry to ask them if they had noticed [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] leaving, but could only see darkness through the [[Dragon's Wrath Glaive|Glaive]].

[[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] was wondering what happened to his gear, but sadly most of it was already sold, the [[Dragon's Wrath Glaive|Glaive]] was returned to him by [[Castle-8]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] gave [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] enough money to pay for his chainmail armor back.
## [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]], you're all bloody
[[The Party]] decided to leave and fight the remaining demon that escaped into the woods last week, so that it could not fester into a bigger problem. [[Nuk]] started twitching as the demon was mentioned and said he did not under any circumstance wanted to join.

[[The Party]] left without him, but not before trying to strike a deal for demon ears with the duke through [[Chamberlain Gerrard]]. On their way towards the woods they came across [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] at [[Hornwood]], who seemed to be rather bloodied. He said he was attacked by multiple demons and that the south of the shard, past [[Arken Fissure]], was being overrun.
## It has been a long time [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent]]
[[The Party]] moved on towards [[Sir Dozak's Forward Camp]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent]] were happy to see each other. [[The Party]] tried to invite [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] to their demon hunt by massaging his ego. Although he was delighted by the honor he was too important to leave the excavation site. They then mentioned that he might pay protection money to [[The Party]] for killing the demons near the camp.

[[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] said that he would offer 9g per person for their services, which was a mighty increase compared to the normal fee of 1g he would pay people. [[Aboouck]] persuaded [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] that if they would tell this was in his name they could get more gold, he offered then 17g and [[Aboouck]] said that he would be happy with the 70g that was offered, which [[The Party]] agreed to.

## We are here to Collect
[[The Party]] continued on their quest to hunt down the demon and continued to the last place where they encountered the demon, crossing the jungle bridge and passing the [[Termite Mound]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was instantly interested in the [[Minotaur]] that was left from the week before and started to pluck him dry as the others intended to continue. First he took the [[Greataxe]] that was next to the body and then intensely started staring at the horns to figure out how to remove them. [[Alaric]] burst in with his [[Starmetal Greataxe|Greataxe]] and cleaved them off, handing them over to [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]].

[[Bill]] and [[Exilian]] went in to take a look at the ichor flowing out of the hole, which was some kind of demonic grease which allowed the demons to move faster while slowing down anything else. [[Enphine]] was ritually casting [[Identify]] to find this out. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] was casting [[Divination]] to find out what happened to the demons here last time, to hear they moved out to the north-west. He also heard a message about the grave danger the forest was in through his ritual. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] called upon an [[Eagle]] to scout and started viewing through his eyes to observe while [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] and [[Enphine]] were channeling their rituals.

[[Bill]] and [[Exilian]] moved ahead to scout in stealth, which everyone else who wasn't occupied followed, except for [[Horatio]]. When the people left behind were done with their doings they left to follow the rest, but not before [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] desecrated the minotaur's body by removing his loincloth.
## Leaping Creatures
[[Bill]] and [[Exilian]] noticed a big [[Frog Demon|Frog-Like Demon]] and 3 [[Goat Demon|Goat-Like Demons]] at a pink portal deep into the forest. [[Aboouck]] was contacting the two using a [[Message]] spell which allowed them to relay the message of the enemies ahead. After hearing this [[Castle-8]] charged in, alerting the enemies to their presence.

The battle started, where [[Castle-8]] was able to catch up in no time due to [[Aboouck]] casting [[Haste]] on him, and where the rest of [[The Party]] had to catch up before being useful. The [[Goat Demon|Goat Demons]] seemed to go down quiet easily even after a couple of tail whips of which only one had an eerie effect on the skin. The big [[Frog Demon]] was obscured by a [[Swarm of Bees]] by [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] but [[The Party]] was still skilled enough to take him down even, without seeing him.

The corpses were very smelly, but that didn't keep [[The Party]] from looting them dry.
## Do you remember anything?
As the fight was over [[The Party]] focused on the portal. [[Enphine]] and [[Horatio]] headed to the portal to study. [[Aboouck]] picked up a small stone and threw it in. A large stone was launched out of the portal, which [[Aboouck]] could barely dodge. [[Enphine]] decided to cast [[Dispel Magic]] on the portal while [[Horatio]] in all his intelligence attempted to pour [[Flask of Acid|Acid]] in. As the acid was about to connect the spell was cast and the portal closed. [[Horatio]] was fully convinced his acid had done the trick and he had discovered how to handle these portal and save the [[Tebinor|Shard]].

Meanwhile [[The Party]] started looking deeper into [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s return, asking him what had happened and if he remembered anything. He mentioned he heard a voice from his past calling for him, telling him his fight wasn't over. He said it sounded like a loved one he knew from a long time ago. [[The Party]] then decided to return to [[Ebonwatch]] and continue their hunt later.
