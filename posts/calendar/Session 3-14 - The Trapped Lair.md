[[The Party]], consisting ofÂ [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Horatio]], [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], [[Bill]], [[Enphine]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]:
- met up in the inn, missing [[Horatio]], [[Enphine]] and [[Nuk]], when [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] told them that the body of a child was found somewhere outside town which looked as if his life essence was drained, the body looked shriveled; then reported it to [[Chamberlain Gerrard]];
- noticed [[Horatio]] and [[Enphine]] walking into the inn, explaining that [[Enphine]] and [[Nuk]] had looked through the [[Telescope]] in [[Sootwall Observatory]], [[Nuk]] lost his mind doing so but [[Enphine]] deciding she was better off by not looking through it for too long;
- had [[Enphine]] explain that she saw some kind of force field covering the dark [[Underside of the Shard of Tebinor|Underside of the Shard]], which had a great many creatures of various sizes working and digging in there;
- asked [[Enphine]] many questions about these creatures and informed [[Chamberlain Gerrard]] about the issue, after which he left to report it to the [[Duke Oakfire|Duke]] himself;
- looked on as [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] presented a [[Sir Dixon's Map|Map]] of a couple of the different [[Shards]] which the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] had expanded to, telling them about the shard [[Asholas]] which was destroyed by a [[Army of Demons and Orcs|Demon Army]], and that it could also happen upon [[Tebinor]];
- had [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] mention the idea of having the [[Lizardfolk]] help them in this battle, to which [[Sir Ginimus]] was surprised as his only history with them was being ambushed and having several of his men killed;
- decided on the loot from the [[Elven Ruin in the Royal Woodlands|Elven Ruin]] and decided to sell pretty much all of it and split the money, [[Enphine]] still considering paying some of the scrolls;
- headed out towards the [[Slumbering Hills]] to aid the [[Lizardfolk]] in their need to fight the [[Troglodyte|Amphibian Creatures]] they faced before;
- came by [[Wheldrake Fortress]], then continued to the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Mine]] without effort, meeting [[Ian]] out front who asked for coffee and mentioned their [[Aboouck|Bunny Friend]];
- reached the poisonous fog, where [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] gave [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] an [[Air Bubble]] around his head in order to scout ahead, where he found a barrier before returning with his findings;
- cleared out a lot of the poisonous fog as [[Enphine]] cast her [[Gust]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] used [[Gust of Wind]] to clear out most of the tunnel before he got poisoned and lost half his health and was cured by listening to the [[Artificer#Protector|Groovy Tunes]] of [[Horatio]];
- went into the tunnel, but faced a last barrier of thick poisonous fog that would not clear it, [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] went in and they heard a fuse being lit before [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] came out shout "RUN!";
- were surprised by a massive explosion as [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] had detonated a [[Gunpowder|Horn of Gunpowder]] when half the cave started to tremble and rocks started to fall;
- watched the gas clear out and the force field gone and proceeded along the stream to a bridge which led to two tunnels as the river was blocked off by debris;
- investigated several tunnels, discovering most of them blocked with only one actually leading to an interesting room, while another ended in a weird flat surface which they could not find anything special about;
- continued into a larger room with a large pile of gold in the middle where [[Bill]] spotted loose rocks among the ceiling;
- noticed two large slabs of rock where [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] scouted around;
- saw [[Bill]] approach the gold which as he touched it turned to a [[Yellow Mold|Yellow Moldy Dust]] that quickly spread through the room, poisoning [[Enphine]] while [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] was protected by his air bubble, after which [[Enphine]] was helped out by [[Horatio]];
- had [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] explore further, discovering a passage down and some ropes leading from back of the stone slabs;
- attempted to push one of the slabs aside, with only [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] really trying and the rest flailing about;
- remembered [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] had a crowbar, which [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] used to lift a slab with the help others, which eventually succeeded;
- followed the passage down, leading to spiral staircase down to an [[Tebinor Troglodyte Lair|Old, Very Wet Ruin]];
- entered the room with [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] in front as a net dropped down on him which he was easily able to avoid, before they were set upon by several of the amphibian [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] who remained hidden until now;
- saw [[Bill]] run north dodging another net effortlessly, dealing some severe damage to several [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] he spotted;
- noticed more and more creatures pouring out of the side chambers before hearing some loud roars as several [[Troglodyte#Juggernaut|Huge Troglodytes]] came charging from the rooms and descended upon the party;
- wavered as they were assaulted from all sides, [[Bill]] quickly going down to the onslaught of the monsters, which also smelled extremely bad;
- kept saving [[Bill]] as he kept bleeding out, each time attacked by the creatures once more, going down three times before the battle was done;
- saw [[Enphine]] cast one [[Fireball]] after the other from the stairs, dealing massive damage, while [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] employed stunning strikes, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] changed into a bear and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] held his ground at Bill, while grooving on the [[Horatio]]' [[Artificer#Protector|Tunes]];
- searched the rooms after the battle was over, finding a wand with a blue flare on its end, which [[Horatio]] identified as a [[Wand of Magic Missile]];
- scouted a bit further into the next room, finding a set of stairs leading down that were entirely flooded;
- turned back and decided to return to the [[Lizardfolk]], cutting up some of the [[Troglodyte#Juggernaut|Bigger Troglodytes]] and bringing some meat for the [[Lizardfolk]], who were quite pleased;
- discussed the progress with the [[Lizardfolk]] and asked them for help with the [[Demon|Demons]]; they insisted they needed to deal with the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] first and needed the party to find a way to continue through the water;
- were told by the [[Lizardfolk]] they were disappointed in the time it took the party to progress, but rewarded them with a small amulet they found;
- returned to [[Ebonwatch]] to rest;
