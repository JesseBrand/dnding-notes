# The Trapped Lair

[[The Party]] met up in the inn, missing [[Horatio]], [[Enphine]] and [[Nuk]], when [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] told them that the body of a child was found somewhere outside town which looked as if his life essence was drained, the body looked shriveled; then reported it to [[Chamberlain Gerrard]].

They noticed [[Horatio]] and [[Enphine]] walking into the inn, explaining that [[Enphine]] and [[Nuk]] had looked through the [[Telescope]] in [[Sootwall Observatory]], [[Nuk]] lost his mind doing so but [[Enphine]] deciding she was better off by not looking through it for too long.

[[Enphine]] had explained that she saw some kind of force field covering the dark [[Underside of the Shard of Tebinor|Underside of the Shard]], which had a great many creatures of various sizes working and digging in there.

[[The Party]] asked [[Enphine]] many questions about these creatures and informed [[Chamberlain Gerrard]] about the issue, after which he left to report it to the [[Duke Oakfire|Duke]] himself. Everyone looked on as [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] presented a [[Sir Dixon's Map|Map]] of a couple of the different [[Shards]] which the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] had expanded to, telling them about the shard [[Asholas]] which was destroyed by a [[Army of Demons and Orcs|Demon Army]], and that it could also happen upon [[Tebinor]].

[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] mentioned the idea of having the [[Lizardfolk]] help the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] in this battle, to which [[Sir Ginimus]] was surprised as his only history with them was being ambushed and having several of his men killed.

[[The Party]] decided on the loot from the [[Elven Ruin in the Royal Woodlands|Elven Ruin]] and decided to sell pretty much all of it and split the money, [[Enphine]] still considering paying some of the scrolls. After they sold all they wanted to sell, they headed out towards the [[Slumbering Hills]] to aid the [[Lizardfolk]] in their need to fight the [[Troglodyte|Amphibian Creatures]] they faced before.

## Anorak Iron Mine

[[The Party]] came by [[Wheldrake Fortress]], then continued to the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Mine]] without effort, meeting [[Ian]] out front who asked for coffee and mentioned their [[Aboouck|Bunny Friend]].

Once inside they reached the poisonous fog, where [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] gave [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] an [[Air Bubble]] around his head in order to scout ahead, where he found a barrier before returning with his findings. They cleared out a lot of the poisonous fog as [[Enphine]] cast her [[Gust]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] used [[Gust of Wind]] to clear out most of the tunnel before he got poisoned and lost half his health and was cured by listening to the [[Artificer#Protector|Groovy Tunes]] of [[Horatio]]

After clearing out the fog they went into the tunnel, but faced a last barrier of thick poisonous fog that would not clear it, [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] went in and they heard a fuse being lit before [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] came out shouting RUN! Everyone present was surprised by a massive explosion as [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] had detonated a [[Gunpowder|Horn of Gunpowder]] when half the cave started to tremble and rocks started to fall

The gas cleared out and the force field was gone and [[The Party]] proceeded along the stream to a bridge which led to two tunnels as the river was blocked off by debris.

After investigating several tunnels, discovering most of them blocked with only one actually leading to an interesting room, while another ended in a weird flat surface which they could not find anything special about. [[The Party]] continued into a larger room with a large pile of gold in the middle where [[Bill]] spotted loose rocks among the ceiling and everyone noticed two large slabs of rock where [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] scouted around.

[[Bill]] approached the gold which, as he touched it, turned to a [[Yellow Mold|Yellow Moldy Dust]] that quickly spread through the room, poisoning [[Enphine]]. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] was protected by his air bubble and [[Enphine]] was helped out by [[Horatio]].

[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] explored further, discovering a passage down and some ropes leading from back of the stone slabs. [[The Party]] attempted to push one of the slabs aside, with only [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] really trying and the rest flailing about.[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] remembered he had a crowbar, which [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] used to lift a slab with the help others. Finally the slab moved and they succeeded to gain entry.

## Troglodytes

Everyone followed the passage down, leading to spiral staircase down to an [[Tebinor Troglodyte Lair|Old, Very Wet Ruin]] and entered the room with [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] in front as a net dropped down on him which he was easily able to avoid, before they were set upon by several of the amphibian [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] who remained hidden until now.

[[Bill]] ran north dodging another net effortlessly, dealing some severe damage to several [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] he spotted.More and more creatures pouring out of the side chambers before hearing some loud roars as several [[Troglodyte#Juggernaut|Huge Troglodytes]] came charging from the rooms and descended upon the party.

[[The Party]] was assaulted from all sides, [[Bill]] quickly going down to the onslaught of the monsters, which also smelled extremely bad. [[Bill]] was saved multiple times as he kept bleeding out, each time attacked by the creatures once more, going down three times before the battle was done.
[[Enphine]] cast one [[Fireball]] after the other from the stairs, dealing massive damage, while [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] employed stunning strikes, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] changed into a bear and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] held his ground at Bill, while grooving on the [[Horatio]]' [[Artificer#Protector|Tunes]].

After the battle was over all rooms where searched, finding a wand with a blue flare on its end, which [[Horatio]] identified as a [[Wand of Magic Missile]]. Scouting a bit further into the next room a set of stairs where found, leading down that were entirely flooded.

[[The Party]] turned back and decided to return to the [[Lizardfolk]], cutting up some of the [[Troglodyte#Juggernaut|Bigger Troglodytes]] and bringing some meat for the [[Lizardfolk]], who were quite pleased, all the while discussing the progress with the [[Lizardfolk]] and asked them for help with the [[Demon|Demons]]. They insisted [[The Party]] needed to deal with the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] first and needed the party to find a way to continue through the water.
The [[Lizardfolk]] were disappointed in the time it took [[The Party]] to progress, but rewarded them with a small amulet they found.

[[The Party]] returned to [[Ebonwatch]] to rest.
