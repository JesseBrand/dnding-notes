## HELP!
As most of [[The Party]] was still away from [[Ebonwatch]], [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] came running into the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] shouting for help. [[Layden Fantail|Layden]], [[Bill]] and [[Horatio]] followed disinterested as [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] explained something was terribly wrong with [[Enphine]].

Outside the [[Ebonwatch|Town]], preparations for the Midwinterfest were underway, as a large [[Midwinterfest Tree]] was being erected and decorated, straight in front of [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard's]] [[Vavian Church|Church]], much to his chagrin. As they arrived [[Enphine]] lay dead, burned to a radiant bacon crisp. [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] started mourning, using his lute to produce some sad hymns.

[[Horatio]] entered into a verbal insults exchange and discussion with [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]], questioning him and his [[Deity|Gods]]. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] was alerted by the commotion and left [[Paxton's Place]] to have a look. They discussed further before [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] got bored and headed towards the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]].

Just then, the expedition to [[Moldarhim]] returned with [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Alaric]], [[Nuk]], [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] and [[Castle-8]] seated on two wagons. They stopped by briefly, some got off at the [[Ebonwatch Church|Church]] while the others continued towards [[Griffindork]] to unload. As they arrived, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] made his appearance as well, returning from the elves in his usual grumpiness.

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] entered the [[Vavian Church|Church]] to have a look, and observed another attempt of [[Enphine]] to reach the other side. He sighed and quickly walked off towards [[Griffindork]]. [[Castle-8]] tried fondling [[Enphine]] in order to heal her, but failed as well. [[Lynel]] had a look and attempted something half-heartedly, but decided to give up and went into [[Ebonwatch|Town]] to follow [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]].

[[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] gave up hope and, together with his assistants, started on a ritual pass pass [[Enphine]] her last rites. He instructed his boys to oil up her desecrated body, but slowly got frustrated by all the questions and told them to work in silence.

[[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] looked over [[Enphine]]'s backpack and took the [[Crystal Teddy Bear Avatar]] to study it. As he did, he noticed a strange attraction from his own [[Paxton's Chest Teddy Bear Avatar|Chest Teddy Bear Avatar]]. As almost everyone was about to leave, [[Enphine]] suddenly opens her eyes and set up. The boys withdrew in fear, [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] reacting surprised. At the same moment, the [[Crystal Teddy Bear Avatar]] was drawn into [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s chest without [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] being able to resist, and merged with his own [[Paxton's Chest Teddy Bear Avatar|Chest Teddy Bear Avatar]]. As it did, [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] fell over onto the floor of [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]]'s [[Vavian Church|Church]], annoying him even more.

[[Layden Fantail|Layden]] flew in, sobbing even more now that his other friend was also lost. [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] mockingly healed [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] back up and [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] started to hug him. [[Enphine]] didn't seem to care about the loss of her [[Crystal Teddy Bear Avatar]], she seemed to be more happy than sad.

Meanwhile, the group at [[Griffindork]] who was unloading the wagons came up with the idea to hire some people in [[Ebonwatch|Town]] to do the unloading for them. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Castle-8]] and [[Horatio]] started to drink a beer while overseeing the labor.

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], [[Bill]] and [[Lynel]] met up at the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]]. As [[Lynel]] attempted to enter as well, he was stopped by a magical barrier. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] apologized and offers him a beer. [[Lynel]] indicated he would rather return to the forest than stay in the cold snow. With his beer he headed out of town, back to the forest. Upon exiting the gates of [[Ebonwatch]] he encountered [[Enphine]], [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] and [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] returning to [[Ebonwatch|Town]]. Startled by the fact [[Enphine]] suddenly lived again, he responded with a [[Turn Undead]], but she shrugged it off as if it wasn't even there. When [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] asked for an explanation [[Lynel]] did so quickly, then bolted off.

[[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], [[Enphine]] and [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] attempted to join the rest at the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]], but only [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] was able to enter. Surprised, they asked for [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] to scout inside to see who was there, and he listed a whole list of everyone currently in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]], which [[The Party]] was not really interested in. He was asked to go inside and ask for [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Bill]], who came outside to have a look.
## The Big Climb
Before any conversation started, [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Castle-8]] and [[Horatio]] also came in. [[Castle-8]] seemed to have the same problem but mainly with his [[Armblade Teddy Bear Avatar]]. Quickly, [[The Party]] decided enough time was wasted this week, and they decided to head out towards the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] at [[Anorak Iron Mine]]. As they walked past the [[Midwinterfest Tree]], something strange happened. A huge purple portal opened, dropping a bunch of [[Gnolls]] out into the amassed group of common folk drawn to the festivities.

The [[Gnolls]] enacted a slaughtered amongst the good people of [[Ebonwatch]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Enphine]] tried to [[Dispel Magic|Dispel]] the portal and were marginally successful, but discovered there were more sources of power than they could quickly disrupt. [[Enphine]], relieved to now be able to cast non-fire spells, cast [[Sickening Radiance]] at the bottom of the [[Midwinterfest Tree|Tree]], damaging further [[Gnoll|Gnolls]] emerging from the portal. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] flew in, attacking a bunch of [[Gnolls]] ravaging on [[Florellius Patar|Florellius]]' son. [[Bill]] flew all across the snow, hitting one [[Gnolls|Gnoll]] after another, accompanied by [[Castle-8]]. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] got surrounded, performing his [[Booming Blade]] on a bunch of them, but started to feel the burden of having two [[Demonic Teddy Bear]] essences merged within him, draining his energy.

[[Bill]] climbed up into the [[Midwinterfest Tree|Tree]] to have a look at what was happening on the other side of the portal. He saw four casters and a whole army of [[Gnolls]] ready to disembark upon [[Ebonwatch]] and shouted out he needed help, hanging upside down in the tree to stick his head out of the portal.

## Sacrifice
[[Horatio]] heroically [[Vortex Warp|Vortex Warped]] himself to the top of the [[Midwinterfest Tree|Tree]] amidst the four casters. After [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] had slashes and knocked some [[Gnolls|Gnoll]] heads off their bodies, they started entering the portal as well. [[Bill]] threw his [[Black Star]] at one of the casters, breaking its concentration. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] utilized one of her gunpowers to knock down another.  [[Horatio]] saw only one option to stop this madness, he had to cast [[Fireball]] on a location from which would hit all the casters. Thus, he cast it on himself, fire bursting out in every direction, lighting up the top of the [[Midwinterfest Tree|Tree]] like a star, and knocked down the concentration of one of the remaining casters.

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] interrupted the last caster's spell by casting [[Dispel Magic]] on the portal and the portal started closing in on itself very rapidly. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] plunged to the ground in a way she was very familiar with. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] just let go of the [[Midwinterfest Tree|Tree]] and tumbled down. [[Bill]] slid down gracefully and slowed down his decent in a controlled manner just before the portal closed, but still facepalmed into the snow. [[Horatio]] jumped off the top of the [[Midwinterfest Tree|Tree]] and tried to go down, but as he did the enormous [[Gnolls|Gnoll]] commander standing on top of the horde pulled out his bone whip and lashed onto [[Horatio]], trapping him just before he managed to escape.

As the portal closed, cutting the top portion of the [[Midwinterfest Tree]] of, [[The Party]] was left in disbelief. After all that slaughter, [[Horatio]] would never to come back to hinder their progress. They noticed how the faithful boombox of [[Horatio]] slowly started to spin down until it finally completely stopped, leaving but an eerie [[Silence]] and crying villagers behind.
