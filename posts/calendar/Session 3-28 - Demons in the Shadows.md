## Peace and Quiet... Finally
![[reusables/pcs/alaric/beep.jpeg]]  

When looking into the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]], one thing was noticeable, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] shouting in frustration towards [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] about her taking all of his coin in a game of dice. Not long afterwards [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] asked [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] if she could [[Fly]] the [[Corrupted Heart]] from last week's adventure away and throw it off the edge of the [[Tebinor|Shard]].

[[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]], annoyed by the [[Starmetal Ball|Beeping Ball]] of [[Alaric]] walked out as he couldn't stand the sound anymore.

Meanwhile, [[Horatio]] and [[Alaric]] were looking into the beeping ball of [[Alaric]]. Hesitant to give it to [[Horatio]], [[Alaric]] told him that if he were to destroy it he would be destroyed himself as a result. [[Horatio]] convinced [[Alaric]] that it was just for the purpose of [[Identify|Identifying]] the (what [[Horatio]] could only describe as a truly magnificent piece of technology) [[Starmetal Ball|Ball]] to see what it's function was. [[Horatio]] explained to [[Alaric]] that it was some form of beacon that was transmitting the location of the device to some unknown receiver. [[Horatio]] suggested to modify it to only disable the beeping functionality of the device but leave the rest intact. [[Alaric]] once again warned [[Horatio]] that if he would break it, the food coming from the kitchen would have a higher street value than the remains of [[Horatio]] once [[Alaric]] would be done with him.

[[Horatio]] and everyone in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] were glad that he surprisingly managed to stop the beeping sound, however the moment [[Horatio]] wanted to brag about it the little device started to beep again, very strangely. Then it stopped again, and restarted for one final beep.

With the [[Starmetal Ball|Ball]]'s beeping gone, [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] took the stage and replaced the annoying beeping with an even more annoying sound. He started singing again and filling the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] with music... until a field of [[Silence]] was cast. [[Layden Fantail|Layden]], even though he was small, was not completely stupid (not far from it though). He noticed his instrument didn't work anymore and flew out of the sphere of [[Silence]], sitting down on [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s shoulder which happened to be at the same table [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] was at.
## No Party Policy
![[sessions/3-28/no-entry.jpeg]]  


[[Enphine]] entered the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] and walked up to [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], reporting to her that the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] would no longer make gunpowder for [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] as outsiders were no longer allowed back in. She also mentioned that the [[1st Observer Orxim Pebblebeard|1st Observer]] who looked through the telescope as the first to do so finally woke up, seemingly still nuts, crazy, mad, out of his mind and extremely paranoid. She said that all they could see through the telescope now is [[Darkness]].

As [[Enphine]] was sharing all this information, [[Layden Fantail|Layden]]'s songs seemed to feel more present and noticeable by [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] herself for some unknown reason. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] was quite able to focus on the conversation though and managed to keep her nerves while this was happening.
[[Enphine]] had a small conversation with [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]].
## [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s vision
[[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] mentioned he had visions of a [[Demon]] sleeping in some room he had never seen before, but the walls reminded him of the [[Elven Ruin in the Royal Woodlands|Elven Ruin]] which [[The Party]] had visited a while back at [[Sir Dozak's Forward Camp]]. This all sounded very serious. [[The Party]] was thinking about going towards the [[Elven Ruin in the Royal Woodlands|Ruin]] to see if they could find the sleeping [[Demon]]. However, when [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was present again he mentioned there were more dire needs at the [[Mythana|Elven Village]]. [[Bill]], confused about the [[Mythana|Elven Village]] which was mentioned, tried to weigh the choices of waking up some big scary demon against fighting some near the forest. He and the rest of [[The Party]] decided to go the forest anyway.

[[The Party]] headed out, leaving [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] behind, as well as [[Nuk]]. They didn't want to be weighed down by him. On the way out they picked up [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] and [[Lynel]].
## The Magnificent
[[The Party]] headed north towards the forest but first made a quick stop at [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent]]. They discussed the reward for the demon ears. Earlier in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] had mentioned that [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] had a new friend named Bravzon, however he was nowhere to be seen, and was not mentioned again. [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] made a remark towards [[Bill]] and his kind, the small kind, which did not sit well with [[Bill]] and a fight almost broke out. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] stepped in between his two friends, explaining he owed his life to [[Bill]] which gave him the utmost respect from [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]]. At that point, [[Bill]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] moved on.

[[Enphine]] tried to up the price for the ears, by saying the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] were also in need for materials and wanted the ears, after which [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] mentioned it was fine and that they could keep them. [[Enphine]] realizing the mistakes of her negotiations then quickly got part of the deal back. [[The Party]] would only need to show the ears rather than hand them over for a lower price, after which [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] would mark them.
## It's been a while, hasn't it
![[sessions/3-28/captain-of-the-guard.jpeg]]  
[[The Party]] moved on, crossing the [[Grassroads|Bridge]] and arrived at [[Mythana]]. The [[Mythana|Elven Village]] was surrounded by a shield, kept in place by [[Yeswynn]] and others. On arrival, [[Horatio]] moved in, running past the [[Myacine|Guard Captain]] towards 2 [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] who were speaking in a language [[Horatio]] couldn't understand. [[Bill]] stepped up as interpreter and told [[Horatio]] he wasn't very loved here and was playing with his life. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] asked the [[Myacine|Guard Captain]] what the recent activities in the surrounding areas were. She mentioned that the [[Huge Demon]] was hiding in the forest to the west and had made two attempts already to enter the [[Mythana]] but they were able to hold it off using the shield so far.
## Demonic Rituals
![[sessions/3-28/demon-ritual.jpeg]]  

[[The Party]] moved west and arrived at a giant wall of [[Shadow]] with a single tunnel into it. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] attempted to cast [[Moonbeam]] but it didn't penetrate the wall of [[Shadow]] above it. Both [[Lynel]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] cast [[Daylight]], one on the shield of [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and one on the log laying on the ground as part of their exit route. [[Bill]] started scouting ahead in hiding outside of the [[Daylight]], and moved forward.

[[Bill]] and [[The Party]] moved through the tunnel until [[Bill]] came across a sight of demons. The [[Huge Demon]] they had encountered before and two demonic [[Minotaur|Minotaurs]], but also a new type they hadn't encountered yet. A [[Demon Spellcaster]] was casting some kind of strange ritual. [[Bill]] signalled back to [[The Party]] that they should wait and headed back to discuss with them. He informed [[The Party]] about what he had seen, and thus they started preparing. Everyone started buffing up, summoning animals, and they went in for the good fight.

The fight went rather smoothly, the [[Elk]] performed as a good meat shield, [[Fireball|Fireballs]] were hurled, Daggers stabbed in honor for the lord Gloop Gloop, firebolts were strewn around. Everything went so smooth that the [[Huge Demon]] even got scared and ran off... right? The [[Demon Spellcaster]] casting the ritual tried to move out as well. Noticeably, the [[Shadow|Shadows]] closed in after, it became clear how the [[Shadow|Shadows]] were being kept at bay due to the ritual. [[The Party]] tried to take note of it and [[Lynel]], [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]], [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] and [[Horatio]] were able to grasp what was going on and could potentially reproduce it later if they were to study for it.

After slaying them all and undoing them of their loincloths the [[Shadow|Shadows]] started to move closer and [[The Party]] hurried towards the caves [[Lynel]] and [[Bill]] had already scouted towards.
## Sneaking into a Cave
[[Bill]] scouted ahead and discovered a cave system not too far. He went inside alone and came across 2 demonic bodies that had been slain by an unknown attacker. A while later [[The Party]] came rushing in, wondering what had happened to [[Bill]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was the one to rush in first and started shouting out: "[[Bill]] where are you?" Moments later [[Bill]] showed up, and they had a conversation as to where he went and what he saw, however somewhat noticeable was that everything they said was being repeated from a hallway further down. They decided to ignore it, however, and moved on further inside. [[The Party]] moved on towards the body of one of the [[Demon|Demons]]. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] started casting [[Spirit Guardians]], which appeared to be something the [[Shadow|Shadows]] did not to like.
## [[Shadow Giant]]
[[The Party]] came upon a huge wall of [[Shadow]] deep inside the cave. As they studied it a [[Shadow Giant|Giant Shadow]] stepped out of the wall of [[Shadow|Shadows]]. The party was scared as hell, so scary [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] shat his pants, dropped his weapon and ran off out of the cave. [[Castle-8]]'s aura inspired heroism into most of the others, preventing them from running off like [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]].  Several more [[Shadow]] emerged from the wall, joining the fight. [[Horatio]] tried to grease up this little piggy, which [[Enphine]] set on fire. [[Lynel]] was radiating an aura of light, preventing any serious injuries. [[Horatio]] was blasting groovy tunes with his boombox. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] was on a roll this adventure. Where he would normally miss most of his attacks, he was beating the shit out of the [[Shadow|Shadows]] just like he was at the [[Demon|Demons]] with his mighty [[Dragon's Wrath Glaive|Glaive]].
## Claustrophobia
After [[The Party]] killed the [[Shadow Giant]] and looted its armor and weapon the [[Shadow]] surrounding them started closing in on them. [[Bill]] rushed to grab [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]'s [[Staff of Beekeeping|Staff]] as they moved out. [[The Party]] rushed through the pass, out of the [[Shadow|Shadows]] as they were closing in more and more and barely made it out in time.
