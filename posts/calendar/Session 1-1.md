Next: [[Session 1-2]]

[[The Party]] consisted of [[Thorin]], [[John]], [[Hera]] and [[Therai]].

Our story starts when [[Thorin]], [[John]], [[Hera]] and [[Therai]] met up in [[The Laughing Bean]], a tavern in [[Neverwinter]] as the [[Dwarf]] [[Gundren Rockseeker]] came in and offered everybody a drink. It became clear that he had struck rich and was looking for adventurers to aid him in a venture he was quite secretive about. [[The Party]] was intrigued and agreed to help [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]], who would leave along with his trusted warrior friend [[Sildar Hallwinter]] before dark and make sure a cart was ready to leave in the morning. [[Therai]] made a mess of the tavern that night, before they all went to bed. In the morning, [[John]] and [[Hera]] found themselves sleeping in the same bed.

The next morning the party encountered the cart they were supposed to deliver to [[Barthren's Provisions]] in the town of [[Phandalin]]. They loaded up and set off, following the [[High Road]] south. In the afternoon of the next day they came upon the [[Triboar Trail]] leading east and took it towards [[Phandalin]], leaving the busy [[High Road]] behind.

Not long after, [[The Party]] spotted a couple of dead horses riddled with arrows on the road ahead, on a narrow portion of the road. They proceeded quietly but were quickly set upon by four [[Goblin|Goblins]] that laid in ambush for them. The goblins gave them quite a hard time, with several of the party members suffering severe wounds before taking them out.
