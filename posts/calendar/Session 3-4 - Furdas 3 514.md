[[The Party]], consisting ofÂ [[Alaric]], [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Castle-8]], [[Horatio]], [[Nuk]], [[Aboouck]] and [[Bill]]:

- examined the [[Notice Board]], noticing a [[Reo Churner|Wanted Poster]];
- discussed what to do, agreeing to go to the [[Sootwall Observatory|Gnomish Observatory]] to help [[Nuk]] now, then go to the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Mines]] to help [[Aboouck]] [[Session 3-5 - Furdas 4 514|Next Week]];
- left the [[Ebonwatch|town]] west, slowly following the trail up the [[Smithwrath Mountains|mountains]] until they saw [[Sootwall Observatory|Sootwall]] before them;
- approached the [[Sootwall Observatory|observatory]], to see two [[Manticore|Manticores]] snacking on a [[Huge Humanoid]];
- engaged the [[Manticore|Manticores]], where [[Castle-8]] was enlarged and body-slammed a [[Manticore]] to the ground, with [[Bill]] and [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] dealing considerable damage;
- examined the guardhouse and the green crystal within, only to be covered by a [[Darkness|dark sphere]] when [[Aboouck]] and [[Bill]] lingered;
- approached the front door to the observatory, read a riddle in [[Gnome|Gnomish]], and had [[Castle-8]] lose his hand as he attempted to open the door;
- entered the [[Sootwall Observatory|observatory]] to be presented with a maze with crushing blocks, spent a long time evaluating this;
- had [[Aboouck]] and later [[Nuk]] run through the maze looking for the exit while being chased by crushing blocks, having [[Nuk]] find the exit and disable the maze;
- navigated the maze together and ascended to the next floor, only to find a small tunnel;
- had [[Aboouck]], [[Bill]] and [[Nuk]] explore the tunnel, only to awaken some [[Clockwork Construct|mechanic constructs]] which quickly fell dormant again, trapping [[Nuk]] in a hole in the ground;
- freed [[Nuk]], crawled through the small tunnel, crossed a few rooms then solved a puzzle regarding a huge statue with an hourglass;
- were greeted by [[2nd Observer Calric Whittlefist|Observer Whittlefist]], who congratulated them and played a game with the involving barrels with [[Magic Items]];
- left with a few [[Magic Items]], leaving [[Castle-8]], [[Horatio]] and [[Nuk]] behind to conduct their business here while the rest returned to town;
