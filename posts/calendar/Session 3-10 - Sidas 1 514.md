[[The Party]], consisting ofÂ [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Castle-8]], [[Drathuul]], [[Nuk]], [[Aboouck]], [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], [[Enphine]] and [[Freya]]:

- noticed a somewhat irritated [[Florellius Patar|Florellius]] watching the drink consumption of patrons closely after hearing [[Bavon]] made a mess of things last night and was now in the [[Ebonwatch Jail|Duke's jail]];
- had Horatio identify several items, sometimes for something in return;
- were surprised when a fiery lady suddenly burst into the tavern, alarming everyone, introducing herself as Freya, and joining the party;
- discussed what quest to undertake, with people being in favor of killing [[Troll|Trolls]] until [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] made them a better offer to help clear the stone [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] to the east, which was supposedly infested by some vile creature;
- left [[Ebonwatch]] where [[Aboouck]] showed his heavily modified [[Teddybear of the Warmage +1|teddybear-wand]] which he offered to the spellcasters, [[Nuk]] taking it but [[Bill]] being severely diappointed;
- headed to [[Gamwater Quarry]] to the east, [[Nuk]] attuning with the [[Teddybear of the Warmage +1|puppet]] along the way;
- reached the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] and were heeded by a female warrior identifying herself as [[Essephy]], warning the party about a blue [[Dragon]] making its lair in this quarry; [[Castle-8]] having no interest and continuing to walk down;
- invited [[Essephy]] to join them and entered the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]], exploring some corridors only to be beset upon by a brilliantly blue dragon named [[Nivrath]];
- tried to reason with it before it decided to attack the party, using a high-pitched scream which heavily damaged the party and downed [[Enphine]];
- noticed [[Essephy]] had turned into a green [[Dragon]] herself, but was watching from a distance with [[Nuk]] as [[Nivrath]] wrecked havoc among the party;
- had [[Aboouck]] blind the dragon after which [[Castle-8]] inflicted some heavy damage, finally getting the [[Dragon]] to calm down;
- had the [[Dragon|Dragons]] explain about a [[Shadow Rift]] down in the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] spewing evil [[Abberation|Abberations]], and the two of them actually keeping the villagers safe by keeping them away;
- agreed to deal with the [[Abberation]], but asked for some healing which was granted by turning [[Enphine]] and [[Drathuul]] into stone for an hour while the rest of the party took a breath, seeing them recovered when turned back to flesh;
- saw [[Nivrath]] part stone and unveil a tunnel down, received instructions how to get back up, then descended into the darkness;
- explored some tunnels and located a [[Shadow Rift]], which they had [[Castle-8]] investigate until he lost a shortsword when it was pulled in;
- found a large room with a sphere of [[Darkness]] at the far end and concluded this must be the [[Shadow Rift|Rift]]. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] could see a hideous creature with tentacles in the darkness and told the party, who prepared for combat;
- engaged the [[Shadow Beholder|Creature]] in the [[Darkness]], being targeted by one colored ray after the other while the creature remained hidden;
- closed the gap as [[Castle-8]], [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] and [[Sam]] rushed into the [[Darkness]] to engage the [[Shadow Beholder|Creature]] in melee, while the rest flung spells at it from range;
- kept damaging the unseen enemy while rays kept striking the party until a red death beam annihilated [[Drathuul]] and he fell to the ground with a big hole in his chest;
- finally defeated the [[Shadow Beholder|creature]]; after it was vanquished the [[Darkness]] disappeared and a great black [[Shadow Rift]] was revealed;
- found a [[Ioun Stone#Insight|Magical Blue Stone]], quickly investigated the [[Shadow Rift|Rift]], took along [[Drathuul]]'s body with them and returned to the [[Dragon|Dragons]];
- were helped back up by the [[Dragon|Dragons]] who were very thankful for their effort and expressed their condolences for [[Drathuul]]'s death; they offered to help his essence, being one of their kin, to return to the world;
- were granted a [[Dragon's Wrath Glaive]] as a reward, left [[Drathuul]]'s body and belongings with [[Essephy]] and [[Nivrath]] and returned to [[Ebonwatch]], knowing the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] was open for production once more;

	The Party travelled to Gamwater Quarry and met the Dragons inside. After a short fight they agreed to aid the Dragons dealing with a great Darkness below. They descended into the tunnels, found several Shadow Rifts and battled with a Shadow Beholder, who unfortunately annihilated Drathuul with a death ray.
