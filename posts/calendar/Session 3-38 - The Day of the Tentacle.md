## House Inspection
[[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] woke up in his [[Ebonwatch Church|Church]] to the lovely sounds of his choir where his boys were singing hymns. His schedule for the day had many things laid out for him, but on top of the list was to perform some preparations for a ritual at [[Griffindork]]. He needed to find the ideal place to set the [[Hallow]] ground's epicenter.

[[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] demanded that the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] sigil be placed on the epicenter of the [[Hallow]] ground to act as its core. Intrigued, [[Castle-8]] came walking in, wondering what was going on and if he would be included from the structure. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] told him what was happening and assured him that he would not have the same problem with [[Griffindork]] as he had with the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]].

After all was set and done, [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]], [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], and [[Castle-8]] headed back in the direction of the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] to meet up with the rest of [[The Party]]. They saw [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] also waiting grumpily outside in the snow as he couldn't get into the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] either. Instead, they decided to head out of [[Ebonwatch]] and headed towards the gate. [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] followed them in the same direction, as that was also where his beloved holy [[Ebonwatch Church|Church]] was located.
## You know I can see you staring at my crotch, right?
As [[The Party]] went out, [[Bill]], [[Lynel]], and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] came walking towards [[Ebonwatch]]. It was immediately visible that [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] had a beam of light emitting from his eyes. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] explained that this was caused by something strange in the forest, and they needed to go after it. Something dark was festering in the forest and it needed to be dealt with before it grew out of hand.
[[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] and [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] were far from convinced. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] tried to get [[Bill]] and [[Lynel]]'s viewpoints explained, and the dire urgency of the situation.
## Well I'll Be Damned
Halfway into the discussion, [[Bill]] smelled something really bad, something beyond "stinky." A grimy humanoid creature appeared to walk in their direction, alongside the wall from the church, followed by a walking [[Skeleton]]. Both [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] and [[Lynel]] cast Turn Undead on them and the [[Skeleton]] fell apart.
[[Castle-8]] tried to make sense of it and cast [[Zone of Truth]], which was pretty much ignored.

Shocked, confused but still remnant, the creature looked at what happened. He reacted by casting [[Chill Touch]] on [[Castle-8]], which seemed to be in vain. All this got the attention of the guards and quickly a battle broke out.

[[Bill]] tried to get the creature to fall sleep, but failed. The creature suddenly split into four identical images. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] tried to cast [[Hold Person]] as the creature tried to flee, but failed. The creature seemed to walk back towards the graveyard, but the whole party and all the guards gained on him and quickly had him surrounded. Urging him to stand down and surrender, [[Castle-8]] called his guard dog [[Pikachu]] from beyond the grave. The creature was impressed and suddenly became open to talk.

He introduced himself as [[Malrik Voss|Malrik]] and told them that he came from that graveyard outside [[Ebonwatch|Town]] (he pointed at it). [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] walked towards the graveyard to inspect the gravestone and quickly  found two empty graves. [[Malrik Voss|Malrik]] followed him to the graveyard and started to magically dig out earth for another corpse. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] asked and showed by example if this was the spell he used, and he cast [[Animate Dead]], raising one of the dead of [[Ebonwatch]] as a skeleton.

[[Malrik Voss|Malrik]] was intrigued and said, "Yes, you can do that too?" [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]], however, was far from intrigued. He was furious and called the guards to arrest [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Malrik Voss|Malrik]] for desecrating the dead. [[Malrik Voss|Malrik]] was confused and said that he had just woken up here. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] tried to talk things down with the guards and said they wouldn't do it again, and it was a misunderstanding, and if they could not let him off with a warning. [[The Party]] realized they should probably not be raising corpses in the graveyard of [[Ebonwatch]] and told the Guards they wouldn't do so again, who left thereafter.

As [[The Party]] was regrouping, a next unexpected visitor showed up in the form of a [[Gnome]]. He told [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] he had a delivery for [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] preferred to take the package into custody, but [[Bill]] referred him towards the graveyard, where [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] and the others were just emerging from.

The package turned out to be a Bag of Holding. The [[Gnome]] indicated it was a delivery on behalf of [[Enphine]], and that it had been lying around somewhere. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] was very curious as to how this was created and was asking if he could have one too. The [[Gnome]] said it was very hard to create and they just happened to stumble upon it. They could help her further if she would come to [[Sootwall Observatory|Sootwall]] herself.
## Are you happy to see me, or is that a meaty pillar?
[[The Party]] eventually made the decision to aid [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and head towards the forest. After a long walk during which they got to know [[Malrik Voss|Malrik]] better, they went deep into the forest towards the [[Cave of Cleansing Waters]]. Everyone except [[Castle-8]] noticed there was something off, and long fleshy tentacles were sprouting out.

They decided to head inside. As they entered, a few of [[The Party]] had a strange effect descend upon them; the world around them started to warp, and they couldn't really see what kind of reality they were part of. One of [[Lynel]]'s hind legs shrunk, [[Castle-8]] seemed like he was made out of paper, [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] became a shriveled man.

The tentacles started to move vigorously and started to attack them, grabbing both [[Lynel]] and [[Castle-8]] and dragging them towards a meaty pillar. [[Bill]] charged off towards it and started hacking into it. [[Castle-8]] cut himself free of the tentacles and tried to do the same for [[Lynel]] but completely missed his target. [[Lynel]] got dragged in further, after which the pillar opened an enormous mouth and bit down hard on him. In response, [[Lynel]] used an ability which damaged the pillar significantly. The pillar was eventually downed, but the strange effects were still there, and [[The Party]] decided to quickly head down further into the cave where there were still more tentacles, but not before a little healing was applied. [[Lynel]] appeared to be in quite bad exhausted shape.
## Déjà vu
When they descended further into the cave they noticed a strange plateau of gory fleshy parts and another creepy pillar. They started to attack the pillar, but not long after the gore suddenly transformed into the [[Huge Flesh Sack Demon Monster]] they fought before; their reality got twisted once more. [[Malrik Voss|Malrik]], new to [[The Party]], suddenly grew a second head and started finally having intelligent conversations.

They started attacking both the pillar and the [[Huge Flesh Sack Demon Monster|Monster]] and did so swiftly, just barely in time. [[Lynel]] was having a hard time with this strange reality he was in; he was familiar with some strange things from the [[Feywild]] but not something like one leg shrinking. When the [[Huge Flesh Sack Demon Monster|Monster]] was finally downed, the effects wore off. Somehow [[The Party]] members were able to decide which of their realities to accept as their truth; reality as they knew it, or the new reality which they were transformed into.
[[Lynel]] got his leg back, [[Malrik Voss|Malrik]] deposed of his second head, and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] grew back his muscles.

## Déjà vu all over again
When [[The Party]] thought everything was over, something strange happened. The gore started to bubble and suddenly the creature resurrected, but a lot larger this time. Reality started to twist again, in much weirder and stranger ways. [[Malrik Voss|Malrik]]'s ears hopped off of his head, sprouted legs and ran out of the cave. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s body suddenly developed a scabby STD effect. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] suddenly gained three times his weight, reminding everyone of [[Nuk]]'s condition. [[Castle-8]] thinned significantly. [[Bill]] suddenly sprouted a second pair of wings, willing or not. [[The Party]] couldn't let the monster stay alive for long and thus rushed to bring it down. Within a matter of seconds it withered.
## Marry "[[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]" Poppins
In order to prevent this from happening again, [[Lynel]] suggested that [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] put the gory fleshy mass in the [[Bag of Holding]] given to him earlier. The moment he did, he was pulled into the bag completely by some extraplanar force. When he couldn't get out, [[Lynel]] rushed in trying to save him, but got dragged in himself too. He was able to jump out in time just before [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] cast [[Dispel Magic]] and the portal was closed off. The last thing [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] saw before everything went dark was [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]'s magic closing off the entrance. The [[Bag of Holding]] reverted to a normal leather bag, and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s only way back was disconnected.

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] grabbed the bag, ran outside, changed into a [[Giant Eagle]] and quickly flew off, as the rest of [[The Party]] sat there, not sure what to do.
