## Guess who's back, back again
[[Castle-8]] was already enjoying [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]]'s newly brewed beer, which was being served in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]]. Meanwhile, [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Enphine]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] walked into the tavern.

[[Enphine]] was wearing a new tiara which she said would stabilize her condition better. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] seemed to have been infected by some kind of strange fungal growth which was sprouting all kinds of mushrooms over his body and gave him a bit of a decaying look. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] directly went to her drinking buddy [[Sir Ginimus]], asking about her self-brewed beer, to which he replied that the supply should be increased in order to inspire the troops in these dire times.
## Blub, blub, blub
[[Castle-8]] joined the conversation showing [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] his new dog [[Pikachu]]. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] was flabbergasted and said "that is absolutely COOL man!"

[[The Party]] was discussing where to go next and quickly came to the decision to go back to [[Anorak Iron Mine|Iron Mine]]. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] was about to head out to perform her errands. Meanwhile, [[Castle-8]] mentioned the goldfish on the table still being there. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] realized he could take a look at it as he spoke fluent animal. When [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] attempted to talk to the [[Goldfish]], he noticed the fish didn't speak fish and noticed that it rather tried to pretend to be a fish. He then, in all his wisdom, decided to cast [[Dispel Magic]] on it.
## Ashes to Ashes
![[sessions/3-36/goldfish.webp]]As the spell was cast, something strange happened. What everyone who wasn't sitting at or near the table the fish was standing on saw, was that the entire table and the people near it vanished in some kind of black hole, disappearing from view.

The people sitting at the table: [[John]], [[Freya]], [[Sarith]], [[Navani]] and [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]], along with [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Enphine]] standing nearby, suddenly found themselves in a dark, pitch-black place with a [[Beholder]] floating right next to them. This scared the [[Shards]] out of [[John]], who immediately started running away in [[Fear]] the moment he was there, disappearing from view. The rest still wondering what had happened to them as the [[Beholder]] started emitting deadly beams in all directions. Both [[Freya]] and [[Sarith]] were instantly [[Disintegrate|Disintegrated]] into piles of ashes within a blink of an eye.

[[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] and [[Navani]] proceeded to engage the [[Beholder]] from up close. [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] cast [[Spirit Guardians]], attracting the attention of the [[Beholder]], who quickly [[Dispel Magic|Dispelled]] it. [[Navani]] engaged with her short swords, but was then lifted up into the air by a telekinetic beam while instilled great [[Fear]], frozen in place before she fell down hard.

[[Enphine]] tried a new approach. She first put a [[Wall of Force]] around herself to subsequently fire a [[Fireball]] towards the [[Beholder]], realizing very well the [[Beholder]] couldn't reach her. Sadly, the [[Fireball]] also couldn't reach the [[Beholder]] and instead exploded within the [[Wall of Force]], the blast contained her immediate surroundings, dealing massive damage to [[Enphine]] herself, nearly bringing herself down, as her [[Crystal Teddy Bear Avatar]] loudly screamed "BURN!". After taking all this damage, [[Enphine]]'s concentration on the [[Wall of Force]] was disrupted. She then decided to put up another [[Wall of Force]] around the [[Beholder]] directly, before she ran away even further, taking her out of the [[Beholder]]'s lair.

This was noticed by [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]], [[Navani]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], who then retreated as well. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] still got quite some massive blows from the [[Beholder]] and was [[Paralyze|Paralyzed]] several times before he made it out by the skin of his teeth.
## Pay up
![[sessions/3-36/ashes.webp]]
Back in [[Black Barrel Inn]], the guards were instantly alerted by the events and came rushing to the place where the table once stood. Before long, John was launched out of the empty space just to run away in [[Fear]], jumping out of the window and sprinting away from the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]]. Not long after,  [[Enphine]] was blasted out, hitting a chair, hurting herself even more. A short while later, [[Navani]], [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] were harshly ejected from the source as well, before the table returned, along with the bowl with the [[Goldfish]] in it, mouthing them off lively in 'fish'.

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] picked up the [[Goldfish]] and put the bowl in his bag, however, the waitress said this wasn't something that was easily done. If the [[Goldfish]] belonged to [[The Party]], it would've accrued a tab, which should be paid in full by the party, and as long as it was there he, it would belong to the furniture. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] said that the [[Goldfish]] actually belonged to his dear friend [[Bill]], who asked him to pick it up. After some bickering where [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] explained the [[Goldfish]] was encountered by [[The Party]] somewhere on a forest road months, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] just paid the tab for the it and continued onwards.

That onwards was quickly halted by the 6 [[Vavian Soldiers|Guards]] that rushed to the table to help, demanding an explanation as to what happened. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] tried to pin it on [[John]], but [[Florellius Patar|Florellius]] didn't fall for it and caught onto the lie. The [[Vavian Soldiers|Guards]] mentioned that according to [[Vaviel Empire|Vavian Law]], the debt open for both [[Freya]] and [[Sarith]] was still due, and the person responsible for the demise should pay off the debt. Yet again [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] delved into his coin purse to pay off the debt.
## 20:00 later
After what seemed like an eternity, [[The Party]] finally decided to head out after some short healing from various sources. As they did, they headed back west towards the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Iron Mine]]. As always they were greeted by their friendly friend [[Ian]] of [[Society of Brilliance|The Society]], who welcomed them profusely. [[The Party]] handed a [[Goodberry]] to [[Ian]], which he just seemed to hold onto.

When [[The Party]] ventured underwater and tried to continue towards their original destination, they noticed it was blocked by a giant boulder, so they headed back to the shore where [[Skriss]] was, only to be greeted by a [[Lizardfolk]]. The [[Lizardfolk]] informed them that the infected [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] had blocked the previous entry, but that the [[Lizardfolk]] managed to clear another path into the labyrinth which they could use. Not much information about the labyrinth was released as they didn't seem to know, except that there would be infected [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] roaming around.
Thus, [[The Party]] headed out into the labyrinth. They attempted to move stealthfully, except for the grumpy chit-chatter of [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]. A strange underwater current was spotted in a passageway to the south which [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] decided to investigate. The moment [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] reached the far end of the south path, he noticed there were 2 crazed, infected [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] waiting to ambush them, and [[Shadowstep|Shadowstepped]] back, warning [[The Party]] of the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]], preventing them from being surprised.
## Should've worn my water shoes
![[sessions/3-36/monkey-bbq.webp]]
A battle commenced, where [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] suddenly wasn't a pesky giant animal blocking everything anymore, but instead cast [[Spike Growth]], significantly hindering the enemy movement. [[Enphine]] shot multiple [[Fireball|Fireballs]] without being hindered by a [[Wall of Force]]. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] walked on water like it was land, and attempted to hit the creatures, sadly missing about half of the time. [[Castle-8]] submerged himself halfway under water in order to deal with sneaky underwater [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] that kept popping up to ambush [[The Party]].

[[The Party]] did well, they seemed to be better prepared than during the previous battle, even though they numbered less, which was a great inspiration to them. [[Castle-8]] seemed to be in trouble though, as he was tanking most of the damage. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] dropped his concentration on [[Spike Growth]] and [[Polymorph|Polymorphed]] near-down-[[Castle-8]] into a [[Giant Ape]]. This scared off all of the remaining [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] in the area, leading to silent surroundings.

[[The Party]] decided to head back towards the main hall where [[Skriss]] and her gang were chilling. [[Castle-8|Ape-8]] started removing the obstructing boulders blocking the main route towards the citadel. [[The Party]] mentioned to [[Society of Brilliance|The Society]] that they should make sure this path remains open and clear for when [[The Party]] returns next week to come and besiege the citadel.
