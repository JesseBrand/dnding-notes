# Small Business to settle of last time
When [[The Party]] opened up the [[Portable Hole]] for the first time, they found 100 gold in there, along with a [[Tankard of Sobriety|Tankard]] and a [[Dread Helmet|Helmet]] which would make your eyes glow red.
[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] mentioned both items were magical. [[Horatio]] said only the Helmet contained certain benefits but not the Tankard.
[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] took the tankard and [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] took the helmet. [[Horatio]] kept the gold for himself, as could be expected.

# Looking across the Border
[[The Party]] had joined together in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]]. [[Bill]] took a seat at the table while [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] was held up  elsewhere. A strange ringing bell sound came from the hallway which was noticed by [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] went to investigate but was stopped by [[Bill]] telling him not to pay too much attention to it and that he would explain it later, thus [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] moved on.

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] shared the details of their audience with the [[Duke Oakfire|Duke]], how the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] intended to claim the [[Tebinor|Shard]] for themselves and how this might politically collide with the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]]' perspective. In the background they heard a group of soldiers shout "FOR THE EMPIRE!"

[[The Party]] noticed how the prices on the menu seemed to have increased, especially imported beverages, but they didn't challenge [[Florellius Patar|Florellius]] about this, they however did decide to pay their tabs. Shortly after they decided to move on to follow up with the invitation that was granted and meet up with the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]].

# An Audience with the [[Tebinor Elves|Elven Elders]]
Arriving at the [[Termite Mound]], [[The Party]] met up with [[Saryarus]], Son of [[Xedaicaius]], not seeming very amused with the sight of [[The Party]]. He nevertheless greeted them. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] offering the fruit/salad/nut basket he had collected from the forest. [[Saryarus]] thanked him but refused to carry it all the way towards [[Mythana|the Elven Encampment]]. [[Enphine]] also had some friendly remarks.

[[Saryarus]] led [[The Party]] through the woods towards [[Mythana]]. Upon the first sight [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] cast a spell to be able to interpret all languages in order to talk with the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] and understand them. By doing so he overheard some kids talking about how they doubted the group of humans would make it out of the forest at all if not instantly executed. Both [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] noticed some [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] hiding in the trees "the trees have eyes and ears", they however did not share this information with the rest of [[The Party]].

[[The Party]] was greeted by a female elf who introduced herself as [[Myacine]], captain of the guard, the military leader of the camp. Looking into [[The Party]], she had noticed [[Bill]] and called him out for being a [[Goblin]]. [[Bill]] started to deny this accusation and after a short discussion the female elf let [[The Party]] enter the [[Mythana|Village]]. [[Saryarus]] led [[The Party]] towards the village square where the fire would normally be lit at night and the village would gather.

Here [[The Party]] met [[Tebinor Elves|Elven Elders]] for the first time. They had already met [[Xedaicaius]], but there were several other [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] here as well. One of them looked very old, even for an elf, who would later introduce himself as [[Tyderius]]. There was another who didn't seem to be looking much like a [[Wood Elf]] but more pale and quiet, his name eluded [[The Party]]; [[Yeswynn]] was also present on the side.

# Introductions
[[The Party]] introduced themselves towards [[Tebinor Elves|The Elven Elders]]
- [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]: Presented the gift basket; Was questioned about his allegiance towards the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]]; Explained how he was part of the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]], but was more aligned with the [[Druid|Druidic]] ways and was forced to join the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] to safe his forest.
- [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]]: Presented her gift, a flask of oil and a quill; was questioned about her ability to fly; was warned that doing so in the forest could elicit a response, since it would not tolerate unnatural flight.
- [[Enphine]]: Was asked about her elfish roots; was asked about why she sided with the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]]; was here for her studies; was offered to leave her ties with [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] behind and join the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] instead.
- [[Bill]]: Was again challenged by the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] about him being a [[Goblin]]; [[Bill]] denied it again; [[Tyderius]] mentioned his old eyes could not be fooled by the skin he was wearing; [[Xedaicaius]] mentioned the [[Goblin]] should be killed on the spot and reaches for his weapon; [[Bill]] reached for his weapon in return; [[Yeswynn]] calmed down [[Xedaicaius]]; [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] calmed down [[Bill]].
- [[Horatio]]: Was asked about his allegiance to the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] and about his strange inventions; indicated he wished to study the [[Tebinor Elves|Elven]] "inventions", meaning magic.
- [[Castle-8]]: Was asked if he was a Construct; was asked about his purpose; Said he was here for vengeance against the corruption; was challenged if the vengeance would not corrupt himself in the process; [[Castle-8]] answered he would ponder on this reflecting question.
- [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]]: Was asked about his mask; the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] offered help to remove it; [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] doubted they were able to but was still interested in the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]]'' capabilities to help out.

# Are you Worthy?
[[Tebinor Elves|The Elders]] were asking the reason for the audience. [[The Party]] mentioned the threat coming from the [[Demon|Demons]]. The [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] mentioned it was the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] who was the threat to the shards. Back and forward discussions ended in an offering by the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] that a quest should prove if they were worthy. [[Tebinor Elves|The Elders]] mentioned one of their respected [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] went deeper into the [[Heart of the Forest]] in search of a darkness that was growing, but he was never heard of again. They mentioned that if they could bring back [[Sylvanus]] (the elf in question) and not harm the forest in the process they would prove their worth.

They explained that the forest would show them the way. As that was said the forest opened up a pathway. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] asked about this phenomenon and [[Tyderius]] explained this was the purest of balance of the forest that allowed the forest to grant passage.

Before departure, [[Saryarus]] offered to guide [[The Party]] to help them find the entrance to the [[Heart of the Forest]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] ensured [[Xedaicaius]] he would protect his son with his life if it had to come to it. Some other questions were asked to [[Saryarus]].

# Entering the [[Heart of the Forest]]
After parting from [[Saryarus]] [[The Party]] headed on until they found a [[Pixie Clearing|Clearing]] in the forest. [[Bill]] scouted ahead and was greeted by a green shape which started hovering around him and talked/shouted towards him. The green shape turned into an [[Elf]], [[The Party]] asked if he was [[Sylvanus]] after which he answered "You know my name?" after which he started attacking [[The Party]]. As he did, 4 trees started moving in on [[The Party]].

[[The Party]] mostly abstained from attacking and tried to convince [[Sylvanus]]; [[Bill]] did a couple of lower cuts towards [[Sylvanus]]; [[Sylvanus]] attempted to attack [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] but failed to do so; [[Castle-8]] started chopping down one of the trees; [[Enphine]] cast [[Dispel Magic]] on [[Sylvanus]] after which he vanished; [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] started to heal and hug the tree which [[Castle-8]] was attacking.

After this encounter a bunch of green wisps started appearing from the nearby forest edge. As they came closer it became apparent that these wisps were [[Pixie|Pixies]]. The [[Pixie|Pixies]] explained that [[Sylvanus]] was haunted and no longer himself. [[The Party]] asked questions about what had happened, and where he was, but the [[Pixie|Pixies]] were unable to answer. They were however able to point them towards his last known location and his cabin in the woods. [[The Party]] decided to look into the [[Sylvanus' Cabin|Cabin]] to see if they could find any clues as to what had happened to [[Sylvanus]].

# The [[Sylvanus' Cabin|Cabin in the Woods]]
[[The Party]] left the [[Pixie Clearing|Clearing]] and followed the [[Pixie|Pixies]] through the woods until they reached the [[Sylvanus' Cabin|Cabin]]. Upon arriving [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] started to pay his respects and started rubbing the first wooden panel of the porch, while doing so [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] moved on towards the door to look for traps, finding one she started disarming it with great precision and cunning. [[The Party]] moved into the [[Sylvanus' Cabin|Cabin]] and started looking through the items, [[Bill]] moved into the sleeping quarters as [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] were scouting the main room. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] came across a magical stone on top of a book. He moved the stone to the side in order to look into the book. Upon moving the stone he noticed there was also a magical trap on the book itself but he was able to disarm it, after which both [[Horatio]] and [[Enphine]] entered the [[Sylvanus' Cabin|Cabin]]. [[Castle-8]] started scouting around the [[Sylvanus' Cabin|Cabin]] and [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] stayed with the [[Pixie|Pixies]].

[[Horatio]] took the stone and started [[Identify|Identifying]] it to great annoyance of [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]. [[Horatio]] ran outside the cabin and started opening his [[Eversmoking Bottle]] after which he opened up his [[Portable Hole]] and put the stone inside. The [[Pixie|Pixies]] panicked and confronted [[Horatio]] not to set fire inside the forest as this was dangerous, after which he closed the [[Eversmoking Bottle|Bottle]]. Great discussions started about the taking of the stone between [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Horatio]] after which [[Horatio]] decided to throw the stone back inside the [[Sylvanus' Cabin|Cabin]].

At the same time [[Enphine]] went outside with [[Sylvanus' Diary]] and asked the [[Pixie|Pixies]] if they could help translate it, after which they replied that she shouldn't take stuff that did not belong to her from the forest.

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] went after the stone and put it back in its place, and noticed something was going on in the sleeping quarters. He went in to find [[Bill]] and told him they should go outside and continue on with the rest of [[The Party]].

# A Short but Hard Stone Idol
[[The Party]] headed out to the last place [[Sylvanus]] was spotted, to find a [[Dwarven Mine]] with a [[Dwarven Idol]] sitting next to it. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] decided to climb (and not fly) into the [[Dwarven Mine]] and do some digging.
Meanwhile the rest of [[The Party]] started looking at both the footprints and the [[Dwarven Idol]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Enphine]] tried to find out if they were able to interact with the [[Dwarven Idol|Idol]] itself but were unable to, [[Castle-8]] however succeeded in interacting by attacking it.

As combat started between the [[Dwarven Idol]] and a couple of [[The Party]] members, [[Horatio]] was hit hard a couple of times leaving him quite wounded; [[Castle-8]] dealt a couple of blows to the [[Dwarven Idol|Idol]]; [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] was sitting on the side, warning [[The Party]] not to attack the statue; [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] changed into an ape just to start de-licing [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]]; [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] continued digging; [[Bill]] tried to remove some golden runes from the [[Dwarven Idol|Idol]]; [[Horatio]] cast a [[Vortex Warp]] on the [[Dwarven Idol|Idol]], teleporting it down into the pit, which ended the combat; [[Bill]] started scraping off more gold off the [[Dwarven Idol|Idol]] afterward but due to the effort it would take he decided not to continue. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was scouring through the area for items just like [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], who found a pickaxe.

[[The Party]] continuing to follow the footprints, but not before [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] flew towards [[The Party]] and was suddenly shot at with a bolt of flaming light, which didn't seem to hurt her but did hit the ape next to her tremendously, and from the dust [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] arose.

# A Warm Welcome
[[The Party]] continued into the forest following the footprints and the passage the forest opened before them, which led them to a [[Dwarven Mining Camp]]. They were heartily welcomed and were led directly towards the main tent.
In this tent they met with the leader of the camp, [[Scotia Hammerarm]] and her bodyguards [[Thyrim Stouthammer]] and [[Brannis Boulderblade]]. They engaged in conversation with them.

[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] immediately realized they had something in common which was brewing ale and was very willing to obtain ingredients from in order to finally brew his own [[Dwarven Ale]], but was cut short as they had to continue.

[[The Party]] learned of a capital city of the dwarves on this shard named [[Moldarhim]] and that it was facing a [[Demon]] issue deep in its mines.
They also found out that [[Sylvanus]] was haunting the [[Dwarven Mine]] whenever the [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarves]] decided to dig there. They had therefore abandoned the [[Dwarven Mine|Mine]] for the time being. [[The Party]] agreed to help and face [[Sylvanus]].

# A Familiar Face
[[The Party]] decided to go back to the [[Dwarven Mine]] and started digging there, after which [[Sylvanus]] showed up and told them about the [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarves]] being evil, destroying the forest and bringing darkness into the [[Heart of the Forest]]. He told [[The Party]] that they should destroy the [[Dwarven Mining Camp]] or perish themselves. [[The Party]] tried to find their way out peacefully and told [[Sylvanus]] he wasn't well, and that he couldn't make decisions like this by himself.

Combat started as [[Bulette|Mole-Like Creatures]] appeared from the walls to aid [[Sylvanus]]. [[Horatio]] threw in a [[Bead of Force]], trapping both [[Sylvanus]] and [[Castle-8]] inside while pushing the rest out of the way; [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] used the shard of light which was sent towards her from the skies whenever she flew to attack the [[Bulette|Moles]]; [[Horatio]] was downed deep in the pit, but was healed back by up [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]];
[[Castle-8]] destroyed [[Sylvanus]] and smashed him into a green dust; The [[Bulette|Moles]] retreated as [[Sylvanus]] was destroyed. [[Horatio]] was downed again when one of the [[Bulette|Moles]] trampled him trying to retreat; [[Bill]] attempted to ride one of them but failed, then tried to save [[Horatio]] and failed again. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] stabilized [[Horatio]].

# Back to the [[Sylvanus' Cabin|Cabin]]
On their way back to [[Mythana]] [[The Party]] decided to visit the [[Sylvanus' Cabin|Cabin]] once more. The [[Pixie|Pixies]] became agitated as they discovered [[Enphine]] had taken [[Sylvanus' Diary]] with her after all. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] stood in the doorway to make sure nothing else was liberated by the party.

# Report to your Elders
Making their way back to [[Mythana]], the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] were surprised to see them back, expecting they would have failed within the [[Heart of the Forest]]. Impressed but still disappointed as they had not solved the issue the Forest was facing, they allowed [[Enphine]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] to stay in the village. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] proposed for [[Saryarus]] to accompany him and witness the [[Demon]] threat first-hand. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] told [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] to protect [[Saryarus]] at all costs, even if it would cost him his own life, including on the way back.

[[The Party]] returned to [[Ebonwatch]] to rest, except for [[Enphine]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]].
