# A Stone Hard Greeting
[[The Party]] met up in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]]. They decided to continue on last week's quest which was tracking down the [[Runaway Slaves]]. After being absent from [[The Party]] for a while [[Aboouck]] had rejoined, seeing three new faces he had not seen before, and thus he questioned what has happened in the time being apart from the group. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] briefed [[Aboouck]] about the recent events on the shard, she explained who the newcomers were and what their intentions were for today.

[[The Party]] moved on, traveling along a similar path as they did last time, across [[Hornwood]], over the bridge (this time), skipping [[Sir Dozak's Forward Camp]] and heading straight to the hill and the [[Grassroads|Long Bridge in the Woods]]. After they had arrived at the [[Termite Mound]] they noticed the [[Giant Anteater|Giant Anteaters]] were still feasting on the [[Giant Termite|Termites]] walking around.
They decided to head on and go into the [[Termite Mound]] into the opening in which they had last tracked the footprints of the [[Runaway Slaves|Slaves]]. The moment they wanted to enter they heard the skittering of the same creatures that had attacked them last time.

# Pest Control
[[The Party]] was forced to defend itself as hordes of [[Giant Termite|Termites]] again came crawling out of every hole and attacked them. A [[Giant Termite|Termite]] queen appeared and tried to feast on them, but was  knocked dazzled by [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] early on in the fight. The nearby [[Giant Anteater|Giant Anteaters]] saw their next meal and also started attacking the [[Giant Termite|Termites]], they were breathing  Cones of Fire and hitting everything that stood in their way. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] who had changed himself into a [[Dire Wolf]] also seemed like a tasty snack to the creatures and also became a target, [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] suffering heavily from these attacks. After the termites were bested and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] lost his [[Wild Shape]] the [[Giant Anteater|Anteaters]] seemed to disperse and continued eating.

[[The Party]] ventured on, all with separate goals in mind. [[Alaric]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] decided to remove their armor as these were badly damaged by the fight. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] did a little dance in order to determine what the magic barrier inside the opening was. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] stayed with him while the rest of [[The Party]] investigated what the barrier themselves.

[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] decided to roll a carcass of a dead [[Giant Termite|Termite]] into the portal to see it vanish into thin air, she then continued her experiment by throwing pebbles at the barrier, and even stuck a dagger in. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] saw [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]]'s attempts and decided to stick his Longsword in. He tried to re-summon his sword by recalling it using his bond, however he was unable to do so. [[Horatio]] decided to take a closer look and cast an [[Identify]] Spell, but as he touched the portal in order to complete his spell he vanished. Baffled by what had happened, but also not wanting to leave their friend behind, some members followed [[Horatio]] through what appeared to be a portal.

# The Paper Realm
Once there, they found a strange realm on a different [[Plane]] of existence, where the dagger and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s Longsword laid on the ground. [[Alaric]] wanted to shout back at [[The Party]] that it was safe to come, but upon sticking his head back in the portal he was once more transported back to the other realm. [[Horatio]] also threw back the weapons which gave the members back in the cave the confidence it was alright to step into the portal. 

When most of [[The Party]] had regrouped within this realm they saw a lake white as snow and a couple of statues on the other side of it. Behind the lake was a majestic waterfall tumbling down a cliff reaching high into the sky. They decided to go to the statues and investigate, circumventing the lake. When nearing it there appeared to be one great statue with three smaller ones in front of it. The biggest statue seemed to start to converse, talking as to how they should cleanse themselves in the lake, how they would get answers to their question after they did. The statue indicated that the waters were the way to cleanse their souls. [[Castle-8]] stepped towards the water and decided to stick an arm in. Upon touching the water he felt a strong pain in his arm, it was so strong he had to fight to get his arm back out.
At this moment, after finishing their ritual, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] finally joined the rest of [[The Party]] into the portal. Upon entry [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] noticed that the water was giving off some dark [[Necrotic Magic|Necrotic]] energy. Looking further down the lake he saw [[Castle-8]] had dipped his hand in, at which point he shouted to get his arm out of there.
Both [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] rushed over towards [[The Party]] to see what was going on. On closer inspection it seemed that the statue wasn't actually the one talking and the wings were not part it it, but were actually couple of hideous creatures behind it. It became clear to [[The Party]] this was a trap.

[[The Party]] made swift work of the creatures behind the statue, mostly because of the ability of [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] to stun them after which the rest of [[The Party]] just bashed in on them.

# The Life-Like Stone Statues
After slaying the dark creatures behind the statue, [[The Party]] refocused their attention to the statues. [[Castle-8]] let off some steam by destroying the center statue, which only [[Enphine]] seemed to be offended by.
Meanwhile, [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] cast [[Dispel Magic]] upon the youngest looking statue, followed by a [[Charm Person]] by [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]. Dazzled after being turned back to flesh, the [[Elf]] looked around and called his father, then became very defensive after resisting the [[Charm Person]] spell.
Seeing the success of the [[Dispel Magic]], [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] decided to also [[Dispel Magic|Dispel]] the female statue, while[[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] dispelled the last statue.

Both confused as to what had happened and defensive as they were surrounded by a group of strangers which consisted in part of people from the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]], the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] went into a heated discussed. When the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] accused the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] of being an evil force that had no regards for nature and set plagues free upon the land [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] demanded they would thank them and demanded acknowledgement for saving them. [[Castle-8]] continued hammering down on the center statue, reducing it to rubble. Inside he found a rolled-up sheet. [[Enphine]] tried to calm down the heated conversation. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] trying to politically tried to come to a solution, but had lost the trust of the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] at this point. [[Alaric]] stormed off because of he considered all of this nonsense.
The conversation had hit a boiling point, so [[Horatio]] decided to make things worse by throwing in a [[Bead of Force]] which trapped both the male [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] as well as [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]. The [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] immediately demanded to be released by [[Horatio]], or he would face their wrath after the minute was over. [[Castle-8]] pushed the ball towards the water's edge, however [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] defused the situation by picking up the ball and flying out of danger.

In anger and frustration [[Girard de Kosigan|Girard]] had left the conversation and joined [[Alaric]] down the hill, after which [[Horatio]] had soon joined.
The group on top of the hill continued bickering on about who was the real evil on the shard, but the group below decided to go back and tried to leave the realm. The [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] however had other plans and did not allow them to leave. The [[Yeswynn|Female]] snapped her fingers and the portal closed in front of their eyes. Now [[Alaric]] became even more enraged and shouted out in anger.

The [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] explained to the group above how they also closed down the other portals to prevent more evil (with which they also meant the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]]) from getting onto this [[Tebinor|Shard]]. [[Enphine]] explained how big of a threat the [[Demon|Demons]] actually ere and how they also infested the area below the shard. Promising that the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] would put efforts into seeing how they could grow rather than destroy the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]], they decided to let [[The Party]] return and reconvene in 1 week at the tail of the bridge. They invited [[The Party]] to rejoin them and take them before their Council of Elders.

Before leaving, [[The Party]] exchanged names with the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]]. The old elf introduced himself as [[Xedaicaius]], the younger male's name was [[Saryarus]] and the reasonable female spellcaster introduced herself as [[Yeswynn]].

[[The Party]] then returned to [[Ebonwatch]] to rest.
