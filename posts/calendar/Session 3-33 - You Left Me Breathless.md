## Not a Breeze
The whole [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] was brewing with liveliness as a new shipment of [[Sam's Ale]] was distributed throughout the masses, a fine strong drink which seemed to have effect on some of the locals, but less so on [[The Party]] members.
[[Lynel]], [[Bill]], [[Enphine]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] came walking in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Enphine]] were talking about how her state was after her [[Necrotic Magic|Necrotic]] experimentation. This had left her soul disconnected from her body. For now it was stable, but that would not last for long if she wouldn't do something about it. The rest of [[The Party]] heard this as they arrived at the table. [[Castle-8]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] questioned her about it but the conversation quickly turned to other matters, such as where to go next. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] shuffled in the knowledge that the [[Demon|Demons]] were continuing their dig underneath the forest, but no one really seemed to notice. [[The Party]] quickly continued on to venture forth and revisited to the [[Ice Cave]] they were forced to flee from last time.

[[Horatio]] attempted to join in as his loot was there, which [[Sir Ginimus]] overheard and said something about the newly drawn out map on the notice board, [[Horatio]] claiming the fame for this was quickly corrected by [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] which gave the credits to [[Bill]], [[Bill]] then shouted out to the tavern that if there were any corrections needed he would like to hear this, for the empire. to which the whole tavern cheered "FOR THE EMPIRE!". [[Horatio]] decided to stay behind and have a few more drinks.
## There Is Something Off About You, [[Enphine]]
[[The Party]] headed out, crossing the bridge at [[Hornwood]] normally...
When they arrived at the [[Field of Ice]], [[Castle-8]] noticed something was off with [[Enphine]]. She didn't seem to draw any breath. He asked if she was fine, but she tried to "blow" it off saying nothing is wrong. [[Castle-8]] tried to cure the illness that had gotten hold of [[Enphine]], but this worked only on her wounds, with reduced effect. The whole [[The Party|Party]] now turned towards [[Enphine]] riddling what had happened. She said it was nothing, didn't even notice herself she wasn't breathing. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] got impatient and confronted [[Enphine]] to be open and honest about it, to which [[Enphine]] just vaguely started making up a story about laying underneath a [[Necrotic Magic|Necrotic]] blanket and now being like this. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], grumpy as ever, had enough of this beating around the bush and shouted out that it's enough and explained she was dead and became an undead, and now she is like this. [[The Party]] has stunned about this and started asking her more questions as to which level of dead she was, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] replied "the dead kind of dead". Grumpy as ever he, [[Lynel]] and [[Bill]] moved on while [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] and [[Castle-8]] continued to ask more questions about this [[Undead]] state. [[Enphine]] explained what she had begun to realize from her condition.
[[The Party]] was getting cold and moved on towards the [[Ice Cave]].

## Bada-BOOOOOM!
[[The Party]] arrived at the cave entrance they were at a week ago, and they saw a whole new horde of [[Zombie|Zombies]] at the entrance. [[Enphine]], not liking to be reunited with her family, launched a [[Fireball]] in the middle of the herd, after which 3 of the undead seemed to remain on fire.
[[Bill]], who had sneaked forwards, saw this opportunity to throw his [[Black Star]] at one of the [[Zombie]] that was on fire and set off a chain reaction, detonating the struck [[Zombie]] and also bursting up the nearby other [[Zombie]]. not long after the last remaining [[Zombie]] that was on fire also exploded, leaving nothing more than just 2 giant [[Zombie|Zombies]] and one fast one.
The small [[Zombie]] seemed to be more interested in biting his own hand and [[The Party]] didn't have much problem downing the big guys. an encounter which might have lasted longer was shortly taken care of mainly because of [[Enphine]]'s wisdom of fire, [[Lynel]] used [[Spirit Guardians]] which did a great deal on the [[Giant Zombie|Giant Zombies]], as well as rooting them in place, but the angelic warriors also seemed to want to attack [[Enphine]], were it not that she was part of [[The Party]] and explicitly excluded by [[Lynel]].
[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] saw the opportunity to grab some loincloths and thus he did, taking some belts with it as he did, which he passed on to [[Lynel]].

## Things are Heating Up
[[The Party]] quickly moved in the [[Ice Cave|Cave]], spreading out to all corners of the cave as the interests of [[The Party]] were a bit misaligned.
[[Bill]] went into the hallway where [[Horatio]]'s gold was, while [[Enphine]] and [[Lynel]] went towards the [[Teleportation Circle]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] went towards a new entrance which contained a little puddle of shallow water.
[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] seemed to have gotten ensnared by something and started hitting the rocks which got hold of him. Doing so revealed a big large [[Skeletal Dragon]] which seemed to be less than happy to have been woken from its slumber.
The [[Skeletal Dragon|Dragon]] roared out a screech causing a great deal of pain to most party members. [[The Party]] engaged in a fearsome combat with the [[Skeletal Dragon|Dragon]], led in the front by [[Castle-8]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], which were blocking its path, but not blocking its deadly radiant fire breath which  devastated [[The Party]] multiple times. Not only was this already a harsh encounter, but more undead appeared from the [[Teleportation Circle]] containing a [[Death Knight]], several [[Wight]] archers and a [[Lich]] spell caster.
[[Lynel]], [[Bill]] and [[Enphine]] seemed to fend these off whilst [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] was burned to a radiant crisp on the ground screaming for help, which nobody could see as [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] also unleashed a [[Swarm of Bees]].
[[Lynel]] tried to turn the undead, but seemed to have no effect on the dragon, however [[Enphine]] was very much afraid and tried to run off, were it not for [[Bill]] throwing a dagger in her back, getting her back to her senses.

[[Lynel]] set up [[Spirit Guardians]], [[Enphine]] several [[Wall of Fire|Walls of Fire]], as [[Bill]] went around stabbing everything he could. Things went down good and bad at the same time, the radiant fire breath was a real killer for [[The Party]], downing people such as [[Enphine]], [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] and [[Bill]] left and right, struggling to stay alive. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] struggled a bit more and found the realm of the death appealing to visit once more.
[[The Party]] made it out just in time, grabbing [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s corpse and reviving him outside the [[Ice Cave]], [[The Party]] half disappointed that they didn't manage to achieve what they wanted but on the other hand happy to come out alive (except for [[Enphine]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]).
