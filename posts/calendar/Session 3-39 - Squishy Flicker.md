## Grief in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]]
Within the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] in [[Ebonwatch]], [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] was crying about [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s demise, to everyone's annoyance. He saw [[Bill]], who was the only one in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] who knew what had actually happened to [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], and confronted him. [[Bill]] started pestering him back by mimicking what he said.
## [[Enphine]]'s New Student
[[Enphine]] arrived at the gates of [[Ebonwatch]], she had a new look and a new companion with her. The guards were very hesitant to let her in, as she looked like she had risen from the dead, or was about to: pale skin, dark circles under her eyes, and a very brittle look overall. Most noticeably though, she was missing a good part of her nose. After some questioning, the [[Vavian Soldiers|Guards]] noticed there was a small, hyperactive [[Gnome]] right next to her. [[Enphine]] explained this was her new student. The [[Vavian Soldiers|Guards]] asked if the student would vouch for her, that if anything were to happen, he would be responsible. [[Flicker Stardust|The Gnome]] agreed and vouched for her. [[Castle-8]], standing outside in the cold since he could not enter [[Black Barrel Inn]], saw the disturbance at the gate and headed out to have a look. With his [[Paladin]] wisdom and powers, he looked at [[Enphine]] and saw she wasn't doing too well and was clearly [[Undead]], but he still saw some life in her. The [[Vavian Soldiers|Guards]] asked [[Castle-8]] if he felt comfortable letting [[Enphine]] in, and so they did.

[[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]] was very intrigued to see [[Castle-8]] and started pelting him with questions, asking if he could touch him. This wasn't the first time [[Castle-8]] was surrounded by fans, and thus he didn't have a problem with it. [[Castle-8]] notified them that the rest of [[The Party]] was in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]], so [[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]] and [[Enphine]] walked inside.

[[Enphine]] went up to [[Bill]], who asked what had happened to her, and she explained to [[The Party]] that she managed to stabilize her condition somewhat, but she was still very brittle and weak. [[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]] was interested in the bar, seeing some familiar faces, and walked off from [[Enphine]]. He noticed some of [[The Party]] members who were there also helped save the [[Sootwall Observatory|Observatory]] from the armageddon caused by a giant manticore.

At the bar, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] the Magnificent, and Sir(/Dame) [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] were having a drink together. They discussed what happened to [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] and how he seemed to be more alive and awake than before. He explained he felt revitalized and wanted to go back into the [[Elven Ruin in the Royal Woodlands|Ancient Ruins]] to finish what he started, especially worrying about his personal [[Vavian Soldiers|Guards]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] explained they still had other business to attend to and had to take care of some problems in the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Iron Mine]]. [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] agreed and indicated he would setup and expedition for the next week.
## [[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]]'s Curiosity and Chaos
[[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]] came up to the bar, startling [[Nuk]]. [[Nuk]] got flashbacks from his time at the [[Sootwall Observatory|Observatory]] and started to stress eat, being continuously supplied with more and more food from [[Aboouck]].
[[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]] was fascinated by the glowing eyes and general mushy look of [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and started pelting him with questions, then his attention span was so short he directly asked about the mushrooms on [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] himself. [[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]] was curious about the science of what would happen if he ate one, so he went for it and bit it straight off of [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]. He devoured one and instantly got noticeably nauseous. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] laughed her bird lungs off seeing this, said she liked him, and offered him a beer to help with the nausea. The beer offered was one of [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]]'s own making, and slightly stronger than the little guy was used to, which had quite the impact on the mind of the little [[Flicker Stardust|Gnome]]. As [[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]] tried to walk away, he tripped on his own feet and fell flat on his face. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] laughed, then helped him up and told him to take it easy for a while.
## Journey into the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Iron Mine]]
[[The Party]] decided to head out towards the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Mine]] to assist with the [[Troglodyte]] [[madness]]. At the entrance of the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Mine]], they were greeted by [[Ian]], who still wished them the best by using the words "the [[Society]] welcomes you."

[[The Party]] entered into the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Mine]] and continued downwards until they came across the bridge next to the whirlpool. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] tried to persuade [[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]] to take a swim across the whirlpool, telling him it would lead to another [[Plane]], but [[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]] was hesitant. [[Castle-8]], impatient as always, decided to walk ahead and head towards the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]], but had to wait for a bit because of a lack of light. [[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]] tried to hold on tight to [[Castle-8]] as the water was quite deep.
[[Bill]] decided this was the perfect moment to try and [[Fly]], attempting to take off near the whirlpool, but forgot how to align his wings properly and plummeted into the water. He was almost sucked into the whirlpool before [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] saved him.

[[Enphine]]'s brittle body could no longer muster the strength to fight against the current, and as she was starting to get swept away, was also saved by [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]].
## A Warning and a Treacherous Path
After they descended further, they ran into [[Skriss]] who warned [[The Party]] not to kill the [[Troglodyte Queen]], explaining that she was merely under an influence and not acting of her own will.

[[The Party]] proceeded past the passage [[Castle-8]] had cleared previously and crossed a narrow stone bridge, which was flooded with water, making the passage treacherous.
## The Summoning and the [[Madness]]
[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Bill]] scouted ahead stealthily. They noticed they were being watched and turned back to warn the rest of [[The Party]]. [[The Party]] then went in and noticed some magical summoning happening—a big [[Frog Demon]] appeared out of nowhere. As they did, [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] noticed something slither away underwater.

[[The Party]] killed it rather quickly. [[Bill]], in a tiny form, attempted to [[Fly]] downwards again but failed and disappeared underwater after hitting the [[Frog Demon]]. [[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]] showed off his party trick with two [[Eldritch Blast|Eldritch Blasts]] blasting from the palms of his hands. The [[Sickening Radiance]] of [[Enphine]] did the trick and splattered the [[Demon]] across [[The Party]] before it dissolved.

After this kill, [[The Party]] noticed a loud, distant, hollow laughter some kind of [[Madness]] was induced over all party members except for [[Bill]].
## Ambush in the Cavern
[[The Party]] arrived in a big open cave. [[Castle-8]], [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], [[Enphine]], and [[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]] just walked nearly oblivious into an ambush by [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]], surrounded by ballistae from every side.

If not for [[Bill]] and [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]]'s quick thinking and actions, it could've ended badly. [[Bill]] climbed up a ledge where a big ballista was sticking out of, aimed at [[The Party]]. He quietly cut the string of the ballista, making it backfire and instantly cut four [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] in half. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] crushed down on the [[Troglodyte Juggernaut]] standing guard.

[[Enphine]] cast her [[Sickening Radiance]] again, which got [[Dispel Magic|Dispelled]] twice, and not by [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] this time — the first one very effective, the second one not so much. [[Castle-8]] was turned into a [[Giant Ape]] whilst [[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]] was on his shoulder, not believing what was happening to them. Castle-ape tried to move forward but struggled black tentacles that had suddenly appeared from the water. The [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] saw Castle-ape as an easy target for practice and fired down a whole lot of arrows and ballista bolts on him.

[[Bill]] started sneaking invisibly along the walls, trying to flank the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] but got some rocks pelted at him by another [[Troglodyte Juggernaut]], who kept missing him. [[Flicker Stardust|Flicker]] cast some kind of eldritch [[Darkness]] variant on the [[Troglodyte]] archers on the bridge. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] hung back and summoned his swarm of bees once again.

## Sudden Escape
Suddenly a dark voice hollered from the back of the cave and a red glowing light built up, shining from the back. As it grew in strength, suddenly large [[Frog Demon|Frog Demons]] appeared standing next to everyone of [[The Party]]. But before they could react, they were teleported out of the cave, ending up very far up in the air. Almost everyone seemed to have some kind of trick up their sleeve to prevent them from falling to their deaths—except for [[Castle-8]], which they only noticed as they got some distance from the bee swarm they all seemed to enjoy, at which point they saw how [[Castle-8]] plummeted towards the grounds. He smashed hard into the ground, creating a significant crater which he had some trouble getting out of. When [[Castle-8]] got up and looked over the edge, he saw a farmer's hat and heard the words "the [[Society]] welcomes you.", feeling just at home again. The rest of [[The Party]] slowly made their way down, with [[Bill]] taking his time and spyglass to study the [[Tebinor|Shard]] some more from this excellent viewpoint.
