[[The Party]], consisting ofÂ [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Horatio]], [[Drathuul]], [[Nuk]], [[Aboouck]], [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], [[Bavon]] and [[Enphine]]:
- met at the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] when [[Nuk]] returned from [[Sootwall Observatory]] with [[7th Observer Jorfan Billowgrin|Master Billowgrin]] and an unknown wizard lady named [[Enphine]], who was in search of money for her research;
- understood from [[7th Observer Jorfan Billowgrin|Master Billowgrin]] that [[Sootwall Observatory|Sootwall]] was under threat from [[Manticore|Manticores]];
- decided on aiding the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] and prepared to depart but negotiated for a breathing apparatus for use in the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Mine]], while [[Alaric]] and [[Castle-8]] signaled they had other business to attend to;
- travelled to [[Sootwall Observatory]] with [[7th Observer Jorfan Billowgrin|Master Billowgrin]] who took them inside through a secret magic circle in the Gatehouse;
- were explained the situation with the [[Manticore|Manticores]] on the [[Smithwrath Mountains|Cliffside]] by the gnomes, then were quickly sent on their way, with the promise of [[Magic Items]] waiting for them upon completion;
- explored the [[Smithwrath Mountains|Cliffsides]] and found a way down, [[Bavon]] 'climbing' down by himself while [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] scouted around;
- were set upon by two [[Manticore|Manticores]], who were easily dispatched;
- scouted further and found a [[Manticore Nests|Nesting Area]], then prepared to attack with a few large stones, among other things;
- assaulted the [[Manticore|Manticores]] down a steep cliff, but were surprised to see a [[Manticore Elder|Huge Manticore]] lording over the pride;
- had [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] climb down hastily while [[Nuk]] created a [[Storm Sphere]] to cause confusion and [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] pelted the [[Manticore|Manticores]] from above;
- had [[Horatio]] and [[Drathuul]] fall down a level due to a rope that appeared to not have been tied too well after all;
- noticed the [[Manticore Elder|Huge Manticore]] retreat very fast, but [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] catching up with it, slaying it, then saw it rise again just to be killed by an arrow from [[Bavon]];
- recovered, looted the [[Manticore Nests|Nest]] for a [[Wand of the Warmage +1]] and the [[Manticore|Manticores]] and their [[Manticore Eggs|Eggs]], then heard a large impact with glass breaking sound, noticing it came from the [[Sootwall Observatory|Observatory]];
- hurried back to the [[Sootwall Observatory|Observatory]] to encounter panicked [[Gnome|Gnomes]] who quickly sent them upstairs while [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] took a peak through the hole from the outside;
- headed upstairs and ran into a [[Manticore Elder|Huge Manticore]] feasting on some dead [[Gnome|Gnomes]], covered in broken potions;
- prepared well then attacked the beast, making use of the [[Ballista|Ballistae]] scattered around the room;
- saw [[Aboouck]] cause [[Bavon]] and [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] to grow in size until [[Bavon]] could pick up a [[Ballista]] by himself and shoot the [[Manticore Elder|Manticore]] repeatedly until it went down, but not before it took down [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] with it;
- noticed [[Aboouck]] taking the [[Wand of the Warmage +1|Wand]] off [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], then returned to the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] for their reward; again picking from several barrels of [[Magic Items]], then returned to [[Ebonwatch]], taking the [[Manticore Eggs|Eggs]] with them;
