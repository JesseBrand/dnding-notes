- watched as [[Sarith]] was gambling with a [[Bill|kid]] in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]];
- watched as [[Exilian]] beat [[Bill]] the child gambling, then recruited him into the party while [[Exilian]] adopted him as his son;
- decided to investigate the dried-up timber supply mentioned on the [[Notice Board]] and left for [[Hornwood]];
- found a broken cart on the road and [[Giant]] footprints leading away from it;
- found a fishbowl with a [[Goldfish]] in it; after [[Bill]] tried to eat it, had [[Exilian]] keep it safe;
- followed the footprints to a [[Hornwood Stream|rapid river]], then spent a very long time attempting to cross it, walking through it, getting swept away, and rescuing each other;
- entered the [[Royal Woodlands|forest]] across the river, found the [[Giant]] sleeping, then got teleported away as they touched it;
- ended up in a clearing in a [[Realm of the Blue Lady|magical forest]], had a voice offering them a deal to either return them or have them serve her forever;
- examined the scout corpses found here, had [[Horatio]] light up the trees around the clearing, then run to escape the flames;
- entered the forest, encountered some large mushrooms that erupted into [[Redcap|angry gnomes]] with heavy boots and huge sickles, then beat them;
- reached a pond where a [[Blue Lady|small blue flying figure]] resided, who told them she was disappointed in them, asked for their names then sent them away;
- found themselves back at the cart with nightfall approaching, decided to go back to [[Ebonwatch]];
- realized nobody could remember the names of [[Castle-8]], [[Horatio]] and [[Nuk]], then thought up new names for them;
