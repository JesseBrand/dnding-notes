- discussed current affairs in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Tavern]] and noticed [[Bavon]] was not getting served anymore;
- were approached by [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent]] who told [[Sam Alderleaf|Sir Sam]] his [[Expedition into the Elven Ruin|Expedition]] was ready to go;
- left with [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] after having been promised treasure and set off towards [[Hornwood]];
- reached [[Hornwood]] where [[Bavon]] attempted to catch a bird, which after dramatically failing ended up amazingly smooth;
- headed into the woods following [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]]'s lead and reached a blocked [[Elven Ruin in the Royal Woodlands|Cave Entrance]];
- had [[Aboouck]] and [[Bavon]] volunteer to place explosives at the entrance, after which [[Horatio]] detonated them;
- noticed [[Elf|Elven]] runes above the entrance as [[Exilian]] quickly headed down, followed by the others, including [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] and his bodyguards;
- reached a large overgrown room with a murky pool in the middle and a glimmering [[Portal]] to the right, then entered quickly;
- were set upon by [[Wood Woad|Living Bushes]] that surprised [[Exilian]] and the others, as they struggled to catch up;
- dealt with the menaces, [[Bavon]] getting injured and [[Exilian]] ingesting some of the murky water;
- noticed they were not feeling too well, a few party members gaining [[Exhaustion]];
- explored the room and examined the [[Portal]]; after [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] was assigned volunteer by [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] to go through but did not comply, a bodyguard attempted to push [[Enphine]] inside, who resisted; [[Horatio]] proceeded to teleport him inside the gate, which apparently did not work;
- proceeded further into the ruin, approaching a crossroads where the party split while [[Nuk]]'s mage hand opened a trapped chest that did not contain anything; [[Bavon]] took the mechanism with him;
- had [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], [[Exilian]] and [[Bill]] reach a large overgrown room with an overgrown chasm and several bells hanging from the wall, then returned to [[The Party]], but not before [[Bill]] could not resist the urge to ring a bell;
- had [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] abandon the split-off members and usher the rest into another corridor, that led to a well at the end of a tunnel;
- had [[Castle-8]] with [[Aboouck]] on his shoulder and [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] approach the well, only for tentacles to shoot out from the well and grab them;
- saw [[Aboouck]] casting haste on two allies, only for his [[Wild Magic]] to trigger and create a puddle of grease at the most inopportune location;
- saw [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Castle-8]], followed by [[Horatio]], be drawn into the well; [[Bavon]] then growing in size before he was drawn into the well too, effectively sealing the stone tube;
- saw the [[Roper|Monster]] do a lot of damage biting [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and Horatio when [[Exilian]] pulled a trick from his sleeve and dropped a [[Bead of Force]] into the well, which landed and expanded into a sphere above [[Castle-8]], [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Horatio]] but below [[Bavon]];
- cut the tentacle grabbing [[Bavon]], then pushed the expanded sphere out of the well, [[Bavon]] - still enlarged - becoming squashed between the sphere and the ceiling;
- pushed the sphere out of the way, after which the [[Roper|Creature]] was dealt with swiftly;
- searched the well while down there, [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] pocketing a heavy magical stone;
- decided to call it a day, went back outside where [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] and his guards started setting up a [[Sir Dozak's Forward Camp|Fowrard Camp]], where some of the party remained as the rest returned to [[Ebonwatch]];
