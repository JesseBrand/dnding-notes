## The [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] Trembles
[[The Party]] had gathered in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] and started looking at what to do. After a long discussion going back and forth, [[The Party]] decided to go after the snakes breathing fire in the woods. This time around, something seems to have changed in regards to [[Nuk]], not just his extra weight. His lust for fighting had returned, and he attempted to leave his bar stool, unsuccessfully. He made his way with a lot of trouble to the table where a part of [[The Party]] was present, stumbling along, pushing tables aside just to get to the other side of the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]].

## Keep Your Pet In Line
But before he got there, Sir Gerard [[Chamberlain [[Chamberlain Gerrard|Gerrard]]|Chamberlain]] made his way towards [[The Party]], or more precisely, towards [[Horatio]]. He confronted him for being the 'Adventurer Manager' of [[Aboouck]], who was highly in debt and by law was in line to be sold into slavery to make up for his debt. After a long pause and stumbling, [[Horatio]] made up his mind to pay the tab this time.

## Fire at the Front Gate
[[The Party]] moved out, and at the front gate, [[Horatio]] started bragging about his new boots, which the grumpy [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] began to gag about. A cockfight broke out where [[Horatio]] started a campfire, whereas [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] began to produce a flame. [[Horatio]]'s campfire started to spread out, which [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] extinguished with his spade water. [[The Party]] started to move out towards Hornwood, part of it already moved forward without looking back. However, [[Nuk]] was having some trouble gaining momentum. The two strongmen of [[The Party]] ([[Castle-8]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]) sacrificed their fresh air by lifting the fat rolls of [[Nuk]] to help him move faster.

## A Bridge Renovated
The first part of [[The Party]] arrived at the lumber mill. They asked a bunch of questions, to which they found the location of the snakes setting fire to the woods. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] donated a total of 6 gold to the lumberjacks to help with the harvest and new tools. He also started to mention how they would solve the problem for free as that would help, in turn, [[Ebonwatch]] itself. Just as he mentioned this, the rest of [[The Party]] arrived, and even though [[Castle-8]]'s hearing was muffled by the fat layers of [[Nuk]], he heard the 'nonsense' coming out of [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]'s mouth and gave a mean look before getting hit by the fat flubbers of [[Nuk]] again. It was very successful, though, as it startled the lumberjack. [[Nuk]]'s weight was a little too much for the bridge, and one of his legs disappeared into the bridge, lodging him in place. [[Castle-8]] decided to give a little nudge and pushed him off the bridge; the momentum gained by [[Nuk]] rolled him forward into a bunch of trees, taking four of them down and being halted by the fifth.

## Snakes, Why Does It Have to Be Snakes!
Meanwhile, [[Bill]], [[Lynel]], and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] moved ahead. When [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] sensed some disturbance in the floor, he wild-shaped into a Giant Constrictor Snake without informing the rest. His transformation pushed aside both [[Bill]] and [[Lynel]], who were confused by what happened. [[The Party]] arriving late came around the corner, seeing a troubling scene, and decided to attack the giant snake, thinking it was one of those told by the lumberjacks. Mainly [[Bill]], dealing massive amounts of damage, forced [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] out of his Wild Shape, revealing what was going on. The disturbance in the floor turned out to be a whole bunch of ash monsters which started to attack [[The Party]].

## Ashes to Ashes
[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] annoyed everyone with bees and was a bit what you expect of an old man, useless; [[Lynel]] started to cast Guardians to repel the monsters; [[Castle-8]] slashed at the monsters while [[Exhaustion|Exhausting]] himself; [[Bill]] stabby stabby stab stab and ninja throwing stars; [[Nuk]] rolled off a cliff and did a thunder jump; [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] did Eldritch Blast; [[Enphine]] downed herself, [[Bill]] saved her with a health potion; [[Horatio]] was a bit lost without fire magic and started DJing. The ash monsters kept blinding the people with ash clouds also when blowing up.

## Hot Stuff...and Snakes
[[The Party]] moved on and started investigating the burned ashes. [[Bill]] moved around some ashes, which started to heat up. A flame serpent with a spear arose and started attacking and summoning more serpents. These serpents were very hot and left burn marks when attacking. [[Enphine]] started to put her intellect to work and began dealing non-damaging magic spells using a giant hand. The monsters were killed relatively quickly by [[The Party]].

[[The Party]] investigated the area and noticed it was burned by something moving through, which was stopped by the water and turned away. However, they haven't found the source of the devistation.
