## The [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] Trembles
[[The Party]] had gathered in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] and started looking at what to do. After a long discussion going back and forth, [[The Party]] decided to go after the [[Fire Snakes|Snakes]] breathing fire in the [[Royal Woodlands]]. This time around, something seems to have changed in regards to [[Nuk]], and not just his extra weight. His lust for fighting had returned, and as he attempted to leave his barstool, he was unsuccessful and fell on the ground hard, breaking several planks in the floor, which [[Florellius Patar|Florellius]] was quick to note in his tab. With a lot of trouble he made his way to the table where a part of [[The Party]] was sitting, stumbling along, pushing tables aside just to get to the other side of the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]].
## Keep Your Pet In Line
Before he got there, [[Sir Ginimus]] made his way around [[Nuk]] towards [[The Party]], or more precisely, towards [[Horatio]]. He confronted him for being the 'Adventuring Manager' of [[Aboouck]], who was highly in debt and by law was in line to be sold into slavery to make up for his debt. After a long pause and stumbling, [[Horatio]] made up his mind and pay the tab, noting this would be the last time.
## Fire at the Front Gate
[[The Party]] moved out, and while walking through [[Ebonwatch]], [[Horatio]] started bragging about his new boots, which the grumpy [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] began to gag about. A cockfight broke out where [[Horatio]] started a campfire, whereas [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] began to produce a flame. [[Lynel]] also started to play with fire in response. [[Horatio]]'s campfire started to spread out, which [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] extinguished with his [[Shape Water]] spell. [[The Party]] started to move out towards [[Hornwood]], part of them already moved forward without looking back. However, [[Nuk]] was having some trouble gaining momentum. The two strongmen of [[The Party]] ([[Castle-8]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]) sacrificed their fresh air supply by lifting the fat rolls of [[Nuk]] to help him move faster.

## A Bridge Renovated
The first part of [[The Party]] arrived at the [[Hornwood|Lumbermill]]. They asked a bunch of questions, to which they found the location of the [[Fire Snakes|Snakes]] setting fire to the woods. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] donated a total of 6 gold to the lumberjacks to help with the harvest and new tools. He also started to mention how they would solve the problem for free as that would help, in turn, [[Ebonwatch]] itself. Just as he mentioned this, the rest of [[The Party]] arrived, and even though [[Castle-8]]'s hearing was muffled by the fat layers of [[Nuk]], he heard the 'nonsense' coming out of [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]'s mouth and gave a mean look before getting hit by the fat flubbers of [[Nuk]] once again. It was very successful, though, as it startled the lumberjack, who dropped his notepad in the river. [[Nuk]]'s weight was a little too much for the bridge, and one of his legs disappeared through the bridge, lodging him in place. [[Castle-8]] decided to give a little nudge and pushed him off the bridge; the momentum gained by [[Nuk]] rolled him forward into a bunch of trees, taking four of them down and being halted by the fifth. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] looked at [[Castle-8]] searching for an explanation, but decided to just go along with it.
## Snakes, Why Does It Have to Be Snakes!
Meanwhile, [[Bill]], [[Lynel]], and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] moved ahead. When [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] sensed some disturbance in the forest floor, which was turned to ash, he wild-shaped into a [[Giant Constrictor Snake]] without informing the rest. His transformation pushed aside both [[Bill]] and [[Lynel]], who were confused by what happened. [[The Party]] arriving late came around the corner, seeing a troubling scene, and decided to attack the giant snake who seemed to threaten [[Bill]] and [[Lynel]], thinking it was one of those they were told about by the lumberjacks. Mainly [[Bill]], dealing massive amounts of damage, forced [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] out of his [[Wild Shape]], revealing what was going on. The disturbance in the forest floor turned out to be a whole bunch of [[Ash Monsters]] which started to attack [[The Party]].

## Ashes to Ashes
[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] annoyed everyone with bees and was a bit useless, but what else would you expect of an old man; [[Lynel]] started to cast [[Spirit Guardians]] to repel the [[Ash Monsters]]; [[Castle-8]] slashed at the monsters while [[Exhaustion|Exhausting]] himself; [[Bill]] stabby stabby stab stab and ninja throwing stars, but got caught in [[Horatio]]'s [[Web]] after being blinded by the creatures; [[Nuk]] and [[Enphine]] were set upon by another group of [[Ash Monsters]], after which [[Nuk]] rolled off a cliff and did a thunder jump to get away from them; [[Enphine]] downed herself with fire by setting her [[Crystal Teddy Bear Avatar]] against herself, [[Bill]] was just in time to save her with a health potion; [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] threw around some [[Eldritch Blast|Eldritch Blasts]] and slashed around with his [[Dragon's Wrath Glaive|Glaive]]; [[Horatio]] was a bit lost without his fire magic and started spreading some groovy tunes. The [[Ash Monsters]] kept blinding the people with ash clouds, also inflicting severe damage when blowing up, breaking [[Concentration]] here and there.

## Hot Stuff... and Snakes
[[The Party]] moved on and started investigating the burned ashes covering the clearing of the forest. [[Bill]] started to dig around in some ashes, which started to heat up, which he noticed too late. A [[Flame Salamander]] with a spear arose from the ashes and started attacking him, summoning more [[Fire Snakes]]. These [[Fire Snakes|Snakes]] were very hot and left burn marks when attacking and being attacked. [[Enphine]] started to put her intellect to work and began casting non-damaging magic spells using a giant hand. The monsters were killed relatively quickly by [[The Party]].

[[The Party]] investigated the area and noticed it was burned by something moving through, which was stopped by the water and turned away. However, they haven't found the source of the devastation and vowed to return next week.
