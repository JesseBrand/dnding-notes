## The Inn trembles
The party had gathered in the inn and started looking at what to do, after a long discussion going back and forth the party decided to go for the snakes breathing fire in the woods.
This time around something seems to have changed in regards to Nuk, not just his extra weight. His lust for fighting had returned and he attempted to leae his bar stool, unsuccesfully. he made his way with a lot of trouble to the table which had a part of the party present, stumbling along pushing tables aside just to get to the other side of the Inn.

## Keep Your Pet In Line
But before he got there, Sir Gerard Chaimberlain made his way towards the party, or more precise, towards Horatio. He confronted him for being the 'Adventurer Manager' of Aboouck who was highly in debt and by law was in line to be sold for slavery to make up for his debt. After a long pause and stumbling Horatio made up his mind to pay the tab this time.

## Fire at the Front gate
The party moved out and at the front gate Horatio started bragging about his new boots which the grumpy Sir Dixon started to gag about. a cock fight broke out where Horatio started a camp fire whereas Sir Dixon started to to produce a flame, Horatio's camp fire started to spread out which Sir Dixon extinguished with his spade water.
The party started to move out towards Hornwood, part of it already  moved forward without looking back, however Nuk was having some trouble gaining momentum. The two strong man of the party (Castle-8 and Paxton) sacraficed their fresh air by lifting the fat rolls of Nuk to help him move faster.

## A Bridge Renovated
The first part of the party arrived at the lumber mill. they asked a bunch of questions to which they heard the location of the snakes setting fire to the woods. Sir Dixon donated in total 6 gold to the lumberjacks to help with the harvest and new tools. He also started to mention how they would solve the problem for free as that would help out in turn Ebonwatch itself.
Just as he mentioned this the rest of the party arrived, and eventhough Castle-8's hearing was muffled by the fat layers of Nuk he heard the 'nonsense' coming out of Sir Dixon's mouth and gave a mean look before getting hit by the fat flubbers of Nuk again. It was very successful though as it startled the lumberjack.
Nuk's weight was a little to much for the bridge and one of his legs dissapeared in the bridge lodging him in place. Castle-8 decided to give a little nudge and pushed him of the bridge, the momentum gained by Nuk rolled him forward into a bunch of trees, taking four of them down and being halted by the fifth.

## Snakes, why does it have to be snakes!
Meanwhile Bill, Lynel and Sir Dixon moved ahead, when Sir Dixon sensed some disturbance in the floor he wild shaped into a Giant Constrictor Snake without informing the rest about this. His transformation pushed aside both Bill and Lynel who where confused by what happened, the party arriving late came around the corning seeing a troubling scene and decided to attack the giant snake, thinking it was one of those told by the lumberjacks. Mainly Bill dealing massive amounts of damage forced Sir Dixon out of his Wild shape revealing what was going on.
The disturbance in the floor turned out to be a whole bunch of ash monsters which started to attack the party.

## Ashes to ashes
Sir Dixon annoyed everyone with bees and was a bit what you expect of an old man, useless; Lynel started to casted Guardians to repel the monsters; Castle-8 slashed the monsters while exhausting himself; Bill stabby stabby stab stab and ninja throwing stars; Nuk rolled off a cliff, and did a thunder jump; Paxton did Eldrich blast; Enphine downed herself, bill saved her with a health potion; Horatio was a bit lost without fire magic and started DJing;
The ash monsters kept blind the people with ash clouds also when blowing up

## Hot Stuff....and Snakes
The party moved on and started investigating the burned ashes. bill moved around some ashes which started to heat up. a flame serpent with a spear arrised and started attacking and summoning more serpents. these serpents were very hot and left burn marks when attacking. Enphine started to put her intellect to work and started dealing non damaging magic spells using a giant hand. The monsters were killed relatively quickly by the party.

The party investigated the area and noticed the area was burned by something moving through which was stopped by the water and turned away, they however havent found the source of the devistation.
