While scavenging the fallen [[Goblins]] and tending to the wounded, [[The Party]] noticed a [[Tiefling]] walking down the road towards them. After inquiring about their intentions, he introduced himself as [[Morthos]] and suggested to join them in tracking down the nearby [[Goblins]].

[[Morthos]] and [[Thorin]] followed the nearby trail into the forest while [[John]] used his [[Druid]] abilities to talk with nearby squirrels, who informed him of  the nature of the area.

Halfway there, the party narrowly evaded a snare trap on the trail, then went forwards a little more carefully.

Not long after, they reached a cave entrance where two [[Goblin|Goblins]] were lazily standing guard outside. [[The Party]] engaged them and rapidly dispatched them.
