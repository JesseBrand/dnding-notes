- saw [[Enphine]] come into the [[Black Barrel Inn|Tavern]] somewhat excited and distressed at the same time, with news from the [[Sootwall Observatory|Observatory]]; she told [[The Party]] the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] had fixed the [[Telescope]] and are able to look under the Shard using some complex mirror construction; it unfortunately turned the [[1st Observer Orxim Pebblebeard|Gnome watching]] [[Madness|Mad]];
- shared news by [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] about some [[Shadow|Shadowy Figures]] appearing around the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] and attacking shipments;
- noticed an old man in a brown robe walk in and ask [[Florellius Patar|Florellius]] for [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]], who directed them to the party where he introduced himself as [[Sir Dixon Fire]] and explained his goals of aiding [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] and cleansing [[Tebinor]] of evil;
- decided their priority was to protect the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]], but [[Nuk]] offered to take [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] along and bring him to [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] afterwards;
- left and set out towards [[Gamwater Quarry]] only to find [[Bavon]] chained up mining stone; after becoming upset [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Bavon]] explained that this was for the better;
- went into the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] and encountered [[Nivrath]] and [[Essephy]] once again, who gave some details about the [[Shadow|Shadow Creatures]]; they explained how they could only be harmed in [[Sunlight]];
- concluded they could not face the creatures right now, then set out to find [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]], but not before informing the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] foreman to vacate the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] during the night, who in turn requested more security around dusk;
- travelled through [[Ebonwatch]] and [[Hornwood]] to [[Sir Dozak's Forward Camp]] where he enlightened [[The Party]] to the contents of the chest, which were 3 scrolls and 4 arrows, who they were quickly able to identify as Disguise Self, Misty Step and Meld into Stone, which they agreed to sell;
- entered the [[Elven Ruin in the Royal Woodlands|Elven Ruin]] once more alongside [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] and his men, then proceeded back to the large chamber with the crevice as [[Enphine]] created a way across the stepping stones by creating a bridge of mud with her spells;
- attempted to open the big door through sheer strength which was utterly unsuccessful, then opened the smaller door with such strength that [[Castle-8]] flew through and landed at the bottom of the stairs;
- explored a small room with a nice old [[Carpet from the Elven Ruin|Carpet]], an engraving of a splendid [[Vicious Longbow|Longbow]] and a [[Pot of Awakening|Flower Pot]] with a green plant growing out of it;
- saw [[Bill]] investigate the plant, which caressed him, instantly creating a bond with him after which he took it along;
- saw [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] perform a silly little dance which supposedly allowed him to see [[Magic Items]], seeing the magic of the [[Pot of Awakening|Flower Pot]] for an instance before [[Bill]] stored it, but also identifying the [[Vicious Longbow|Longbow]] on the wall as magical;
- attempted to ring the bells in the main chamber simultaneously when they heard the movement of stone over stone;
- had [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] notice a [[Glabrezu|Great Demon]] emerge from the other side of the chamber, sprout a pair of wings, cross the gap then engage them in combat;
- noticed [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] communicate with the [[Glabrezu|Demon]] who gave him an evil smile, as [[Castle-8]] and [[Bill]] were grabbed by great pincers while [[The Party]] engaged it, [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] joining the effort but his men merely lighting the situation with their torches;
- saw [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] change into a [[Bear#Brown Bear|Brown Bear]] during the fight while they slew the [[Glabrezu|Demon]], who upon his death made a mental connection with [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], who was left somewhat shocked;
- headed out to the room where the [[Demon]] came from and explored it to find many books, chests, supplies and potions lost beyond recovery, but did find a [[Cloak of Elvenkind|Green Elvish Cloak]] in remarkable good shape while [[Nuk]] was able to salvage an [[Alchemy Set]] and [[Bill]] recovered some potion bottles;
- found a hole in the wall which [[Sir Dixon]] explored as a little [[Spider]], only to return back to the first main hall where they encountered the first [[Portal]];
- returned to the chasm room and attempted to open the main doors through sounding the bells in the correct order; after a lot of attempts [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]]'s first suggestion proved to be right and the double doors opened;
- emerged into a huge tall room supported by pillars and carefully went inside as [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] started another silly dance;
- discovered a huge white [[Dragon]] statue while [[Castle-8]] approached a huge dead tree which he attempted to light on fire, only to have it emerge to be a [[Treant#Corrupted Treant|Living,Aangry Tree Creature]];
- engaged the [[Treant#Corrupted Treant|Tree]] together, throwing [[Fireball|Fireballs]], smites, daggers and heavy punches while the creature performed sweeping attacks, throwing the party backwards and bringing [[Sir William the Torchbearer]] down, but ultimately could not withstand the sheer might of [[Enphine]]'s [[Fireball|Fireballs]];
- noticed a [[Portal]] behind the [[Treant#Corrupted Treant|Creature]] light up, then proceeded to investigate it, [[Bill]] and [[Castle-8]] discovering it was possible to travel between this [[Portal]] and the one at the entrance;
- discovered a stone shaft down into the ground, which was filled with rubble, when [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] indicated the next step in the [[Expedition into the Elven Ruin|Expedition]] would involve excavating it;
- noticed a faint magical aura within the [[Dragon]] statue before leaving the [[Elven Ruin in the Royal Woodlands|Elven Ruin]] and returning to [[Ebonwatch]];
