## A Tribute
The day started off with a song just as beautiful as a rooster's sounds in the morning. The [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] was filled with [[Layden Fantail|Layden]]'s amazing voice, vocalizing the good and true words about [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent]].
[[Bill]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] walked up to the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]]. Opening the door they were confronted with [[Layden Fantail|Layden]]'s eardrum-menacing vocalization. Having no interest in being confronted with this before having a beer, they opted to wait outside until the song had stopped.
## A Cult Following
[[The Party]] noticed how [[Castle-8]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] were surrounded by a whole group of villagers who clearly admired them. All of them were waiting to hear the wise words told by these two heroes. Mentions of a cult being started were uttered, to maybe do some good on the [[Tebinor|Shard]].

## Did Somebody Notice the Noticeboard?
[[The Party]] had turned towards the noticeboard and saw there were a bunch of new items posted on it. [[Chamberlain Gerrard]] mentioned the need to map the [[Tebinor|Shard]] and mentioned that the [[Water Supply]] was being polluted. He also mentioned the lumber supply was being threatened by creatures near [[Hornwood]]. [[The Party]] also noticed there was another item posted, but not by the [[Chamberlain Gerrard|Chamberlain]]. It regarded an invitation by the Society. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Castle-8]] recognized the name that was written on it, which was [[Ian]]. They asked [[Florellius Patar|Florellius]] where [[Ian]] was, who directed them to a specific room in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]].

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] seemed concerned about [[Nuk]]'s well-being and decided to try and cure him of it, but wasn't very successful in his attempts.
## The Society Welcomes You
A part of [[The Party]] decided to go and visit [[Ian]] in his room. When they arrived they noticed [[Ian]] sitting on his bed, staring blankly before him. He kept repeated the same line "The Society welcomes you. Please meet them at the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Mine]]". Several attempts were made to get him to act differently, but they were all unsuccessful. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] had her suspicions. she decided to cast [[Identify]] on [[Ian]] to see what was wrong with him. It turned out his mind was blanked out by a powerful [[Spells]].
[[Enphine]] wanted to dispel it, but as uncovered it was a extremely powerful [[Spells|Spell]]. She required aid to help and make it succeed. Against her will and out of pure need she turned to [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] for help. He offered to help her, but in return he asked that they would take him on one of their adventures when he requested to. He gave her a massive boost in her self-confidence which helped her to cast the [[Mind Blank|Spell]].

[[Enphine]] broke the spell, freeing [[Ian]] from his predicament. He was, however, unable to recollect the events that took place while under the influence of the [[Mind Blank|Spell]]. he was instantly shocked as to what all these strangers were doing in his room and shouted out to the [[Vavian Soldiers|Guards]]. The situation quickly escalated as [[The Party]] mentioned he was under a [[Mind Blank|Spell]] making him think they were responsible. Fortunately he was quickly calmed down by an offering of beer.

[[Ian]] joined [[The Party]] in the common room where he was served some of [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]]'s best, but very strong [[Dwarven Ale]], getting him quite drunk in no-time.

Shortly afterwards [[The Party]] decided that there wouldn't be much of a town to save if they all died from the contaminated water and ventured forth to the [[Water Supply]] to resolve the issue.
## Crabs and People
[[The Party]] traveled along road west towards the [[Slumbering Hills]], passing past the [[Wheldrake Fortress]] and the former portal within. They noticed a platoon of [[Vavian Soldiers|Guards]] was still posted there. They went on and followed a path into the [[Slumbering Hills|Hills]].

Once [[The Party]] arrived near the [[Water Supply]], near the bottom of a cliff, they came across a couple of [[Vavian Soldiers]], one of them wounded. They asked what had happened to them, to which they answered they had been attacked by monsters upstream. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] walked forth and healed the wounded soldier, who was ready to fight again. They told [[The Party]] they should talk to [[Lady Valga]], their captain, about the events that had transpired.

[[The Party]] went up cliffside and faced a situation where several [[Vavian Soldiers|Guards]] near the edge of the waterfall had confronted 3 [[Crab-like Monsters]], who lay dead. A couple of [[Vavian Soldiers|Guards]] had placed a bunch of rocks to block the flow of water down the waterfall, which was mildly successful. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] started to investigate the monsters to get some hints as to what they were and what their weaknesses were. Meanwhile [[Bill]] started to sample the water by taking a sip and tasting it. Under other circumstances [[Bill]] would've turned green, were it not for his disguise kit. Regardless, it was noticeable this water was bad news. [[Bill]] turned very sick, but was quickly cured by [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]].

[[The Party]] decided to talk to [[Lady Valga]] to ask more details about the monsters and their attacks, about where they should go and what to look for. [[Lady Valga]] explained that the monsters tended to hide in the water, tainted it. The tainted water came from upstream.

## A Crabby Bridge
[[The Party]] moved upstream, climbing another cliff. When nearing a bridge over a waterfall, [[The Party]] heard crackling sounds down from below the cliff. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] drew his sword with great grace. When doing so a strange blob of [[Grease]] suddenly appeared out from his body, creating a puddle on the ground around him. The same [[Crab-like Monsters]] they had noticed before climbed up the cliff and started attacking them. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] got grappled and paralyzed. The [[Crab-like Monsters]]  then proceeded to lick his shiny bald head, before throwing him to the ground far below.

[[Castle-8]] attacked, pushing one of the [[Crab-like Monsters]] off the cliffside, making it fall to the ground below with his [[Thunderous Smite]]. [[Enphine]] repeatedly cast [[Ray of Frost]] to which the [[Crystal Teddy Bear Avatar]] started to react. It started to heat up intensely. Upon touching it some of the energy backfired towards [[Enphine]], burning her in the process, which seemed to ease the heat within the [[Crystal Teddy Bear Avatar]]. [[Bill]] attacked and put one of the crab monsters to sleep causing it to lose its grip, crashing to the ground right next to the still-paralysed [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], which instantly woke it up again again. [[Bill]] leaped off the cliff, holding one of his daggers firmly and pointing it down towards the [[Crab-like Monsters]]. [[Bill]]'s knowledge of aerodynamics was sublime, swirling down with his dagger forward, crashing down directly onto the crab's head. His mastery  was too much for the monster to handle, causing its skull to be pulverised. The little tiny [[Goblin]] stood up from the hole left in the corpse and stared down at the other [[Crab-like Monsters|Crab-like Monster]].
The other [[Crab-like Monsters|Monster]] which was already on the ground witnessed the whole event while sucking on its lollipop named [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], was still processing the whole thing when a horse slammed down on top of  it. Slightly less graceful than the [[Goblin]], [[Lynel]] didn't have the mastery of aerodynamics [[Bill]] did and crashed down on top of the [[Crab-like Monsters|Crab-like Monster]]. When the [[Crab-like Monsters|Monster]] recovered and wanted to react it was hit by the spirit guardians of [[Lynel]] which followed him down the cliff.

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was picked up by [[Lynel]] and carried back up the cliff. [[Bill]] hitched a ride on [[Lynel]], hanging into his manes. Halfway to the top [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] recovered from the paralysis. [[The Party]] regrouped.  [[Castle-8]] however, was impatient and moved forwards by himself. When the party followed him they arrived in a stinking scrapyard filled with puddles of green, polluted water.

## Stench and Murky Waters
As [[The Party]] arrived in the scrapyard, they witnessed a [[Hippo-like Creatures|Hippo-like Creature]] whose tentacles grew from all sides. They decided to engage and moved in. The [[Hippo-like Creatures|Creature]] moved into the water. The water manifested 4 tentacles trying to latch on to [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], [[Castle-8]], [[Enphine]] and [[Bill]]. They succeeded in grappling all of them except for [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], who were dragged into the water and under while still being grappled. Out of the trash-heaps surrounding them and the murky pools, several other [[Hippo-like Creatures|Hippo-like Creatures]] jumped out at them, including some very stinky, nasty, giant ones. 

[[Enphine]] cast multiple spells, including a [[Lightning Bolt]] and [[Sickening Radiance]], which weren't Fire-based, causing the [[Crystal Teddy Bear Avatar]] to heat up once more and causing her quite the agony. A while later she figured this out and started hurling [[Fireball|Fireballs]], which was her speciality anyway. [[Bill]] was slicing with his daggers. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] hacked away with his [[Dragon's Wrath Glaive]]. [[Lynel]] cast [[Fearie Fire]], lighting up the [[Hippo-like Creatures|Creatures]] from underneath the water. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was grappled by one of the monsters and beaten to a mush by using [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] as an object. Another two big [[Hippo-like Creatures|Monsters]] appeared from the water and a pile of junk in the distance. [[Horatio]] had his groovy tunes on board and was playing with [[Fire Bolt|Fire Bolts]] and [[Fireball|Balls]]. [[Castle-8]] was grappled and tried to get out of it, placing a couple of smites on the [[Hippo-like Creatures|Creature]].
[[Enphine]] cast one more [[Fireball]], enraging one of the monsters, which suddenly started lashing out to everything surrounding it, taking [[Enphine]] down with him. It left it very weakened afterwards though, and [[Lynel]]'s [[Spirit Guardians]] were able to mop it up quite easily. 

[[The Party]] managed to finish off the [[Hippo-like Creatures|Monsters]], using [[Lynel]]'s [[Spirit Guardians]] to great effect, and noticed how the water recovered. They searched the scrapyard and found a couple of very valuable items.
