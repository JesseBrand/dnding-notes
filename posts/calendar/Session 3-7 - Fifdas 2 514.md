[[The Party]], consisting ofÂ [[Alaric]], [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Horatio]], [[Nuk]], [[Aboouck]], [[Bill]] and [[Bavon]]:

- tried out [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]]'s newly brewed beer, which was very good!;
- discussed on what to do, negotiated about [[Troll]] heads, then decided to go and aid the [[Lizardfolk]] in [[Anorak Iron Mine]] in their struggle against the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]];
- saw [[Ship Bescond|Ship the Blacksmith's Son]] delivar a newly crafted [[Starmetal Quarterstaff]] to [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]];
- headed to [[Anorak Iron Mine]], met [[Ian]] outside, then spoke to the [[Anorak Iron Mine#Inhabitants|Other Miners]] inside, who were somewhat grumpy and yearned for coffee;
- headed into the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Mine]] and noticed the wooden platforms around the whirlpool;
- met with the [[Lizardfolk]] who were preparing an assault on the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]], who asked them to clear the area first;
- explored around while [[Horatio]] enhanced the party, following a shallow river to a small island in a small lake where Sam was ambushed by a [[Giant Lizard]], which the party fought and slew;
- returned to the [[Lizardfolk]], but were told to fight an even bigger one;
- followed another stream where they were ambushed by 2 [[Black Ooze|Black Oozes]] which were quickly cut up into a lot more by [[Alaric]] and [[Nuk]] before being defeated;
- got their non-magical weapons severely damaged by these creatures, but were quick to switch to either magical means or cheap weapons;
- followed the stream further to a marble-looking chamber, which turned out to be a [[White Maw|Giant White Slime]] when they entered, sealing the entrance behind them;
- were severely battered by [[White Maw|the chamber]] while attacking it on all sides and unleashing some powerful magic before the marble crashed down around them, useless;
- found a magical gemstone in the remains, which was identified as a [[Ioun Stone#Protect|Ioun Stone]] and was given to [[Alaric]];
- returned, only to find the [[Lizardfolk]] had dragged the dead [[Giant Lizard]] out towards their lair and were feasting on it;
- joined the feast, said goodbye to the [[Lizardfolk]] and returned to [[Ebonwatch]];
