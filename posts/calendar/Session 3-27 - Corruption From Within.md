## Beeping Ball

There was a cosy atmosphere within the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]], there was only one thing that was noticeably disturbing it, which was a repeating beep coming from the bar, to be precise from [[Alaric]]. [[Alaric]] was looking into an [[Starmetal Ball]] with a red light emitting from it. [[Alaric]] was thinking what he could do to see what was inside, quite unlike him he didn't want to smash it as it looked too valuable to break it. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] [[Identify|Identified]] the [[Starmetal Ball|Ball]] but could not find any magic and noticed it was a mechanical thing that might have something inside it.
This ball was noticeable annoying for many people within the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] but none dared to approach the big half-orc to do anything about it.

## No Egg Policy
Later on [[Enphine]] came into the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] telling the disappointing news that her newly loved unborn (dragon)child wasn't allowed into the [[Sootwall Observatory|Observatory]] due to events happening in the past. She mentioned the event being the time the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] gathered a bunch [[Manticore]] Eggs, which attracted some unwanted attention. Since then a strict no [[Blue Dragon Egg|Egg]] policy was effective.
It was mentioned that [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] took the [[Blue Dragon Egg|Egg]] elsewhere for save keeping, [[Nuk]] said that he could take care of the [[Blue Dragon Egg|Egg]] as well, but the suggestion was put aside as [[Nuk]] devoured 3 sets of eggs straight after this idea.
## Old Man Crawling
After a long time [[Bill]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] walked into the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was looking terrible and required the support of [[Bill]] to remain standing. When reaching the table [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] collapsed and crushed down to his knees. He was looking horrible and [[The Party]] started asking what had happened. Both [[Bill]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] explained how the [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarves]] started to become corrupted and were hurting the [[Heart of the Forest|Forest]] and thus indirectly [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]. [[The Party]] put other plans aside, such as fighting demons or [[Shadow|Shadows]] and turned their attention to the [[Dwarven Mine|Dwarven Mines]].
## Horsey
As [[The Party]] was about to venture out they heard a lot of noise coming from the front gates. when they took a look they saw a rather aggressive [[Centaurs|Centaur]] at the gate, shouting something him wanting his [[Blue Dragon Egg|Egg]] back. [[The Party]] challenged the [[Centaurs|Centaur]] as to which rights he had to claim the [[Blue Dragon Egg|Egg]] for himself. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] ran into the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] to grab what he thought was the [[Blue Dragon Egg|Egg]] the [[Centaurs|Centaur]] was talking about. The [[Centaurs|Centaur]] explained he was the guardian of the [[Blue Dragon Egg]] belonging to [[Essephy]] and [[Nivrath]]. At about this time a grumpy old man called [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] came walking by, asking what the holdup was, walking past the [[Centaurs|Centaur]] without much regard. [[The Party]], seeing how the [[Centaurs|Centaur]] knew the names of the dragons, decided to explain that the keeper of the [[Blue Dragon Egg|Egg]] is currently [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and that he should talk to her. The guards however didn't let the [[Centaurs|Centaur]] in and thus the [[Centaurs|Centaur]] made a deal with [[The Party]] that if he would help them out he would get an introduction to this [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] bird-person. The [[Centaurs|Centaur]] introduced himself as [[Lynel]] and joined [[The Party]].
## The Mines
[[The Party]] continued to venture towards the mines, this however didn't go very quickly as [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was dragging behind. Eventually [[Castle-8]] decided to carry [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] on his shoulder and thus quickened the journey and prevented a whole lot of further discussions. [[The Party]] continued towards the forest and were remembered that on their way back they should visit [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] as they still had some demon ears to trade in. When arriving at the [[Heart of the Forest]] it was noticeable how [[Bill]] was able to easily navigate through the [[Heart of the Forest|Forest]] and lead [[The Party]] towards the [[Dwarven Mine]].

Once there [[The Party]] descended into the mines, mostly with grace except for [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] who could barely hold on and [[Lynel]]. [[Lynel]] had quite some difficulty on the first ladder but learning quickly he went with ease on the second one.

[[The Party]] entered the [[Dwarven Mine]] and heard a hammer clinging on metal further inwards. This however stopped rather quickly as [[Alaric]]'s [[Starmetal Ball|Ball]] made his first beep of many yet to come.
[[The Party]] was stunned by the amount of [[Adamantine]] they saw in the mine and wanted to extract it in order to use it to forge weapons and armor. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] reminded them that the mining is what made him weaker in the first place and that they should leave it be.
## Corruption At Heart
[[The Party]] went deeper into the caves until they saw a giant blob of metal come to live, which was actually a [[Adamantine Ooze|Oozing Rock]]. Surprised by the sight [[Alaric]] and [[Bill]] knew how to deal with these kind of things and started hacking and slashing with great force into the [[Ooze]], destroying it before it was able to deal more than one strike.

Little did they know the fight was from over, a crystallized [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarf]]-like created shouted from the northern cave that she had to 'enable it' and out of the darkness a giant [[Adamantine Golem]] came forth, with steam and heavy paces striking towards [[Alaric]]. [[Castle-8]] soon rushed forward to try and fight off the priest, the [[Adamantine Golem|Golem]] and a second [[Adamantine Ooze]] that appeared. They managed to kill the [[Ooze]] rather quickly but seemed to have a lot of trouble with the priest and [[Adamantine Golem|Golem]]..

Suddenly out of the western cave another mutated [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarf]] appeared, which seemed oddly familiar, it was [[Scotia Hammerarm]], but infected/corrupted by the [[Adamantine]]. She was enraged and started attacking [[Lynel]]. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] came to help out and started defending [[Lynel]]. At the same time [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] banished the big [[Adamantine Golem|Golem]] out of existence which [[Lynel]] noticed, who started protecting [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] by grabbing hold of him and then turning both of them [[Invisibility|Invisible]].

Another [[Ooze]] showed up at the south end of the cave from which [[The Party]] came, but was held at bay by [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] who turned into a [[Giant Toad]] and [[Bill]] who was doing flips and twirls while attacking the [[Ooze]].

[[Enphine]] was busy [[Fear|Frightening]] [[Scotia Hammerarm|Scotia]] and was trying to find out which type of Elemental damage the creatures were vulnerable against, but all types seemed to do either no or little harm, until [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] reached for and removed his mask, making his eyes burn bright purple. It seemed to have a devastating effect on [[Scotia Hammerarm]]. At that point [[Enphine]] took the opportunity and started blasting away with her [[Fireball]], making short work of [[Scotia Hammerarm|Scotia]].

Not long after [[The Party]] turned to the last remaining enemy on this plane of existence and beat the living shit out of her. Half a minute later the [[Adamantine Golem|Golem]] returned back from its banishment but wasn't responding anymore as if it was missing a command from its master. [[The Party]] ceased to engage it.

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] sensed that the bodies of the enemies needed to remain behind as this was part of the [[Heart of the Forest]]. The missing [[Adamantine|Adamantine Ore]] was also to be returned. The Armor of the [[Adamantine Golem|Golem]] and the Weapons were ripe for the picking as the forest seemed to have lost its connection with it. Also, the [[Adamantine Golem|Golem]] contained a [[Adamantine Golem Heart|Heart]] which was badly corrupted and could no longer stay within the [[Heart of the Forest]].
