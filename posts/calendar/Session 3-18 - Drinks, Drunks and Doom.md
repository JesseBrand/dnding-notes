# Adventure Agent at your service
Most of [[The Party]] gathers up in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]], everyone except [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Enphine]]. Here [[Aboouck]] shares the happy news of him getting a new job, he is now the new chef at the tavern, his cooking seems to do well, an opinion shared by all but for [[Bill]] and [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] who show a noticeable sign of dislike for the food.
[[Aboouck]] also informs [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] that his share for the quarry needs no longer be sent to [[Aboouck]] himself as he has hired an agent, an "Adventure Agent". His agent will take care of all his money administration so [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] needs to deposit the money to his agent, the agent being [[Florellius Patar|Florellius]]

# The fiddling box of [[Exilian]]
[[The Party]] decides to head and towards the Elven Village of [[Mythana]] to continue their quest, but something strange happened when they stepped out the door. [[Exilian]] flew off towards a nearby tree and put down a box, [[The Party]] saw how the box was heavily shaking and headed out to inspect what was happening. Upon opening the box 3 rats became visible, they seemed to be a bit tangy and on edge. [[Exilian]] heard some voices of these [[Mad Rat|Rats]] in his head saying things like "kill me" and "finish it". The [[Mad Rat|Rats]] seemed to spark specific interest from [[Bill]], who wanted to start eating them. [[Exilian]] stopped him from doing so and wanted to investigate them further. [[Aboouck]] attempted to calm their nerves with some coffee from his bottle, but the coffee seems to disappear the moment it entered the box; the [[Mad Rat|Rats]] seem to remain in the same state. [[Exilian]] took one of the rats on his hand and continued to hear more voices in his head. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] fed the rat which crawled on [[Exilian]]'s hand a mushroom which he had found in the [[Underdark]]. The [[Mad Rat|Rat]] instantly shrunk to an even smaller size, after which [[Exilian]] quickly put it back in the box in order not to lose it. [[Exilian]] asked [[Horatio]] to [[Identify]] the rats, who picked it up and started casting his [[Identify]] spell. [[Horatio]] learned what the [[Mad Rat|Rats]] could do, the [[Mad Rat|Rats]] were enchanted and could be weaponized and sent towards a target to explode into a [[Fireball]]. They could communicate with people who have the ability to cast [[Fireball]].

# A Less Than Warm Greeting
[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Enphine]] were already present in [[Mythana]]. As [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] saw the party approaching he walked towards [[Enphine]] and asked for the [[Sylvanus' Diary|Diary]], explaining he saw [[Exilian]] and wanted to ask him to read the book using one of his [[Comprehend Languages|Spells]]. [[Enphine]] handed the [[Sylvanus' Diary|Diary]] over by making it float in the air while she was meditating. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] then met with [[The Party]] as well as [[Myacine]], who wasn't amused by [[The Party]]'s appearance as they didn't succeed on resolving the issue the week before. [[Aboouck]] starting questioning the rewards of the quest where he was reminded that saving the heart of the forest and having the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] as allies were to be the rewards themselves. Some strategic mumbling by [[Horatio]] and [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] happened about devious uses for the elves and down talk, which was questionable a political strategic move.

# Shiny Creatures and Even More Shiny Creatures
[[The Party]] headed out towards the [[Dwarven Mining Camp]]. On their journey towards the [[Heart of the Forest]] [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] explained that the forest had grown darker and that [[The Party]] should not kill anymore creatures or trees within the forest or it would not result in their favour. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] explained the plan to propose to the [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarves]] that they should mine elsewhere, such as [[Anorak Iron Mine]] where the [[Lizardfolk]] live. This would be a win-win situation where the [[Tebinor Elves|Elves]] would get the forest, the [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarves]] the mine and the [[Lizardfolk]] would get rid of the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]]. 

On the border of the [[Heart of the Forest]] [[The Party]] was greeted by the [[Pixie|Pixies]] they encountered last time they were inside. They were giving out a dire warning that once they enter this time the forest would not let them back in until they defeated what was troubling the forest. [[The Party]] mentioned this was their intend and continued.

# Beer, Beer and Even More Beer
On their way towards the [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarves]], [[The Party]] heard rumbling in the distance. They chose to ignore it for the time being and continued towards the [[Dwarven Mining Camp]]. Upon arrival [[The Party]] was welcomed openly and were dragged into the chief's tent, where they were directly offered guest beer. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] refused to drink the beer at first, then attempted to deceive the dwarves by spilling all the beer into his beard. This however went utterly terrible. At the same time [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] offended the dwarves by pouring his beer into his own tankard, which prompted the dwarves to question if there was something wrong with their tankards. The dwarves turned back to [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] demanding he should drink the beer or get out. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] attempted to elude the dwarves again by taking a small sip of the beer but letting it stream into his beard instead. When he lowered the jug he noticed the whole jug was empty. Unknowingly he was saved by a [[Minor Illusion]] cast by [[Aboouck]].

Discussions started as [[The Party]] started up the idea of the dwarves digging for ore elsewhere. They showed their uniquely crafted weapons and indicated they could point the dwarves towards more of this ore. The dwarves said however that the [[Adamantine]] ore they were mining here could only be found in very specific locations and that they first wanted proof that this special ore [[The Party]] mentioned was present in sufficient quantities to warrant a mining expedition. The dwarf mentioned they needed the ore as it was the strongest they ever found and they needed it to fight the [[Demon Armies|Demon Army]] at their own [[Moldarhim|Stronghold]]. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] almost ended up in a fight in order to proof the strength of his weapon, this was stopped due to the lack of refined [[Adamantine]] present and was instead turned into a drinking competition, some of [[The Party]] interpreting this as the dwarves would be moving if they would be out-drank by [[The Party]].

# Even More Beer Than Before
The creatures part of this contest were: [[Scotia Hammerarm]], [[Thyrim Stouthammer]], [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Alaric]] and [[Bill]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] would serve the beers and on special request made sure the beloved tankard of [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] would be returned to him every time it was refilled. After 6 rounds of beers [[Bill]] started singing songs, which was quickly silenced after 1 more beer. One beer later [[Alaric]] also fell over with a loud smash, while [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] seemed to be unaffected by the beer except that his belly seemed to grow due to all the beer. After the next beer [[Scotia Hammerarm|Scotia]] passed out and [[Thyrim Stouthammer|Thyrim]] forfeited as was entrusted with the duty to keep [[Scotia Hammerarm|Scotia]] safe, resulting in [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] winning the drinking competition. After all was done [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] not only restored consciousness to [[Bill]] and [[Alaric]] but also to [[Scotia Hammerarm|Scotia]] as a sign of good faith.

The dwarves accepted the idea of initiating an expedition to the newly mentioned mine on one condition, that the ore was available in the other mine. Therefore they would send [[Brannis Boulderblade|Brannis]] with [[The Party]] to investigate. Before heading off [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] requested to see the ore that they had in store.

# The Collapsed Dig Site
Before heading out to the place where they had heard the noise coming from forest, the party decided to have a look at the dig site which the dwarves mentioned. [[Brannis Boulderblade|Brannis]] was stunned by the fact that the idol which the dwarves placed was suddenly lowered into the refuse pile instead of being on the altar which they made. [[Exilian]], [[Aboouck]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] had never seen the dig site before and were stunned by what they saw and asked a bunch of questions about it. Not dwelling too long at what they saw [[The Party]] decided to continue onwards to the place where the sound was coming from earlier.

# Birds, Caves and Utter Doom
When nearing the place where the sound came from and what was expected to be the cleansing springs they heard a couple of birds which quickly decreased to one tiny blue bird at the entrance of a cave. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] started talking to the bird which warned him about a darkness within the [[Cave of Cleansing Waters|Cave]] and that they should run before it was too late. [[Bill]] saw how tasty the bird looked and started licking his lips, thereby startled the bird which drove it away.

[[The Party]] decided to enter the [[Cave of Cleansing Waters|Cave]], upon entry [[Bill]] saw some shiny crystals and ran straight towards it, resulting into being ambushed by 2 strange looking oozing creatures. [[Alaric]] came to [[Bill]]'s aid and beat them down with two might blows. Further down in the cave a strange and loud noise erupted. [[Bill]] moved in to investigate and saw a [[Giant Floating Pus Blob Monster]] with tight chains which scared him shitless, making him run back. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] changed into a [[Giant Spider]], started crawling up the ceiling and moved onwards. Quickly the rest of the party moved in. The creature started to target [[Alaric]] and [[Aboouck]] leaving them poisoned and exhausted. The creature started giving off some poisonous aura which damaged most of the party who were close by. In an attempt to boost [[The Party]], [[Aboouck]] started casting a [[Haste]] spell, holding onto [[Alaric]]'s knee and shouting out to [[Exilian]] to come closer so he could also receive the benefits. [[Exilian]] flew off towards [[Aboouck]] and as [[Aboouck]] cast the spell something strange happened. The little rabbit started heating up and exploded into a massive [[Fireball]] damaging almost all of [[The Party]]. After the fire and the smoke disappeared the devastation of the event became clear. The little rabbit lay down on his back and was downed, resulting in the spell wearing off and both [[Exilian]] and [[Alaric]] becoming lethargic and needing  recover from the effects of [[Haste]] leaving their body too soon.

This shocking effect turned many knees shivering and caused most of the party to flee in fear of their lives. Leading the exodus was [[Horatio]] who attempted to cast a spell before running off. [[Alaric]] followed, daeling out two more blows before running off. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] fell off the ceiling as he turned back from being a [[Giant Spider]] healed up [[Aboouck]] and then also fled back. Remarkably [[Brannis Boulderblade|Brannis]] made up her mind and seemed to be fearless and charged towards the creature, followed by [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] suddenly appearing from the darkness. Hit by a final blow the creature erupted and its guts spew all over [[Brannis Boulderblade|Brannis]], who was downed by it.

[[Bill]] went after the last creature remaining and threw a dagger at it, killing it. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] headed over towards [[Brannis Boulderblade|Brannis]] to heal her after noticing the coast was clear while [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] patched up both [[Aboouck]] and [[Alaric]] which were no longer poisoned afterwards.

# Closing the Portal
[[The Party]] started scavenging the area;
- [[Exilian]] and [[Bill]] started milking the corpse of the big creature for poison, [[Bill]] succeeded while [[Exilian]] barely escaped getting poisoned himself.
- [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]], [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] started looking around in the area for items, finding nothing but crates. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] harvested some mushrooms and crystals.
- [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] casted dispel magic on the portal and closed it.

When [[The Party]] left the cave they noticed how the forest was less dark and it seemed to have restored slightly, more birds had returned.

[[The Party]] left the [[Heart of the Forest]] and split, some returning to [[Ebonwatch]], others heading back to [[Mythana]] or [[Anorak Iron Mine]].
