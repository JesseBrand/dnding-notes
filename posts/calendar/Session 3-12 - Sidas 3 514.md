[[The Party]], consisting ofÂ [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Castle-8]], [[Exilian]], [[Horatio]], [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], [[Bill]] and [[Bavon]]:

- met up in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Tavern]] where [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] made an announcement about the [[Duke Oakfire|Duke]] paying them to safeguard the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]];
- quickly departed to join [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] at the [[Sir Dozak's Forward Camp|Forward Camp]] in the [[Royal Woodlands]], then headed back into the [[Elven Ruin in the Royal Woodlands|Elven Ruin]] together;
- saw [[Bavon]] and [[Exilian]] examine the pool of water once more as [[Bavon]] threw multiple gold coins into it after which [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Bavon]] explored the previously uncovered tunnels once more, much to the ire of [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]];
- headed into the room with the big bells, where they noticed a [[Gnoll]] stuck in the high growth inside the great chasm dividing the chamber;
- approached the [[Gnoll]] only to hear him utter something about the [[Darkness]] coming, before the plant growth turned on them;
- formed a line with [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] up front with his glaive while [[Castle-8]], [[Bill]] and [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]]'s [[Vavian Soldiers]] held back the [[Bloodvine|Vines]], while the others attacked the [[Bloodvine|Plant Creature]] from a distance;
- beat the [[Bloodvine|Plant Creature]] then regrouped, noticed [[Bavon]] try and pickpocket [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]], which everyone was alarmed to when a loud alarm went off, then had [[Exillian]] show how pickpocketing should really be done if they intended to using his invisible [[Mage Hand]];
- witnessed [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] go down hard on [[Bavon]], pointing him at his responsibilities and addressing [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] to keep his employee under control;
- had [[Exilian]] continue and run into the next room while all this happened, trying to cross some slippery stepping stones but failing and falling into a crevice, then be promptly assaulted and swallowed by a [[Shambling Mound|Giant Plant Tentacle Creature]], unable to see or breathe;
- ran forwards to aid [[Exilian]], [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] instructing [[Bavon]] to stay behind and wait and have one of his men guard [[Bavon]];
- saw [[Paxton]] and [[Bill]] engage another [[Shambling Mound|Plant Creature]] that had crawled up, before the creature swallowed [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] whole;
- turned their attention to these two [[Shambling Mound|Plant Creatures]] as [[Exilian]] was forgotten and [[Bill]] was also swallowed for a short while;
- had [[Horatio]] create a puddle of grease, not really helping the situation, as the [[Shambling Mound|Plant Creatures]] were engaged one by one, with the help of [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] and one of his men, who went down in the onslaught;
- did not pay attention how [[Bavon]] disobeyed his guard, engaged the [[Shambling Mound|Plant Creatures]] from a distance, then got in a fight with the [[Vavian Soldiers|Guard]], killed him then hid his body down in the trench, with nobody except [[Horatio]] noticing;
- finally took care of the [[Shambling Mound|Plants]] then got into another shouting match with [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] who was now furious at [[Bavon]]; [[Bavon]] saved his hide lying about the guard who supposedly fled while [[Castle-8]] really needed to restrain himself;
- distracted [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] enough for [[Sam]], [[Exilian]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] to search the trench for treasure, finding a small heavy chest that did catch [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]]'s eye, but then climbed out on the other side and opened it secretly, removing a couple of items then closing it back up again;
- evaluated the next room, which was opposite of the crevice where the first [[Bloodvine|Thorny Plant]] was fought, but decided to return to [[Sir Dozak's Forward Camp|Camp]] to rest and recuperate;
- exited the [[Elven Ruin in the Royal Woodlands|Ruin]] while [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent|Sir Dozak]] asked for [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]]'s input on what to do with [[Bavon]] and whether or not he could be trusted... and kept alive;
