# Mystery Egg
The morning started off with a fresh cooked meal by [[Aboouck]], he was sharing this meal with [[Exilian]]. The fried egg was well-prepared and smelled pretty pleasant. As soon as the two started digging into the meal they both became a little bit drowsy and wary. [[Aboouck]] was knocked over hitting the table on his way down and suffered quite some damage in doing so. [[Exilian]] seemed to get the better part of the meal and suddenly gained some strength, the protein seemed to have done him good. 
[[Exilian]] noticed [[Aboouck]] wasn't doing so well after he himself had regained notice of his surroundings again and shouted that [[Aboouck]] needed some help. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] offered [[Aboouck]] a beer of his own making with a health potion mixed in, which sprang [[Aboouck]] back up from the ground.[[Castle-8]] came up and helped out by laying his hands on [[Aboouck]] and healing him up a bit. Later on [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] joined the group in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] and noticed [[Aboouck]] could still use some extra healing. He spoke the words "May the forest be with you" and [[Aboouck]]'s wounds magically closed further.

# Last Week's Activities
After the party met up [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] started explaining how he and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] went to [[Moldarhim]], trying to bring the shipment of [[Adamantine]] Ore. He indicated they got lost a couple of times on the way. They headed out of the [[Dwarven Mining Camp]] in a straight line but somehow always ended up back in the [[Dwarven Mining Camp|Mining Camp]]. They had tried several different ways but only succeeded once only [[Brannis Boulderblade|Brannis]] was accompanying them. He mentioned how they laid eyes on the big [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarven]] city of [[Moldarhim]] but were not allowed to enter. The [[Tebinor Dwarves]] said they required a trading contract, and they didn't have them, they would have to prove they had a successful enterprise with proofs of the legal sourcing of their incomes before the [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarves]] would start up the procedure to grant them a trading contract. This left them standing outside [[Moldarhim]] at the [[Moldarhim Trading Post]] at the entrance of the gates, never seeing the inside nor seeing the demon threat that was spoken of.

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] mentioned his business visit of the [[Dwarven Mining Camp]] and said he noticed the [[Heart of the Forest]] was the entity who wasn't too happy with the [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarves]]' stay. He also mentioned he was warned by the [[Tebinor Dwarves]] of an Assassin roaming the forest and taking out the [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarves]] travelling to and from the mines.

[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] mentioned how she had heard from her friends that the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] was creeping with shadows and that the workers were too afraid to work there anymore and thus no stone was mined from the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]]. Thus the urgency to have a look into it was greatly increased, as there was no income created from there. [[The Party]] agreed to head there, however [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] explained how he didn't have the [[Daylight]] spell prepared, which was required to fight off the shadows, thus making it impossible for [[The Party]] to defend the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]].

[[Chamberlain Gerrard]] heard this and mentioned there were still [[Troll|Trolls]] which needed to be taken care of at [[Arken Fissure]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] replied by saying that maybe it should be made more attractive by raising the price, after which [[Chamberlain Gerrard|Gerrard]] mentioned it sounded more like they were afraid to fight them. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] heard this and mentioned that it was not wise to insult us if they wanted cooperation after which a whole discussion started on who they served. [[Aboouck]] told [[The Party]] he had previous experience with [[Troll]] and proposed a plan to "cultivate" them by having them regrow from minor body parts. Part of the group decided to ignore the conversation and headed out of [[Ebonwatch]] to continue their quest, after which the remainder of [[The Party]] followed.

# Fewer and fewer Miners
[[The Party]] traveled onwards and eventually ended up at the [[Dwarven Mining Camp]]. Noticeable was that the green glow that surrounded them the last time [[The Party]] visited them was longer around them, but also that there were a lot fewer [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarves]] left in the [[Dwarven Mining Camp|Camp]].
The dwarves warmly welcomed [[The Party]] by presenting them with beer, Sir [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] drank down her beer and then unnoticeable swapped out her jug with the one from [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]. The [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] mentioned how they were hunted down by assassins in the forest after which [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] taunted them a bit.

# A Burned-Out Tower
[[The Party]] decided to move on quickly and followed the green/blue light further in the forest as soon as they spotted it. It led them back into the dead [[Marrowgrove]] and towards the [[Burned-Out Tower]] that [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] had scouted before.
The only entrance visible was about 20 foot high, which made it difficult for [[The Party]] to enter the tower. [[Aboouck]] asked [[Castle-8]] to give him a hand and throw him upwards. He got close and was able to grab on barely, almost slipping away, but he used his back legs to jump that last part and made it doing so.

When [[Aboouck]] reached the platform he noticed there was another purple magic tile which [[The Party]] had also seen at the [[Marrowgrove Clearing|Clearing]] in the forest. [[Aboouck]] tapped it with his foot from a distance. Instantly the tower seemed to restore itself and was no longer burned and damaged. Being at the entrance [[Aboouck]] also saw a gentleman inside the tower behind a desk writing down some scribbles.

As soon as the tower was rejuvenated [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] flew up and wanted to see what was happening.
[[The Party]] yelled at [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] to drop a rope, and so she did, then continued onwards. [[The Party]] still attempted to ask if [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] could tie the rope, but she had chosen to ignore the cry for help.

[[The Party]] decided that [[Castle-8]] would be heavy enough to function as a counterweight, [[Enphine]] climbed up the rope first, followed by [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], [[Exilian]] [[Bill]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] tried to help out [[Castle-8]] by holding the rope at the top so that he could also get up into the tower.
Meanwhile, the part of [[The Party]] that was already inside the tower saw how the [[Elf]] that had to be [[Sylvanus]] opened up a hatch on which [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] was standing. She was quick enough to jump out of the way before falling down. [[Sylvanus]] then went down and [[The Party]] followed. [[The Party]] watched as [[Sylvanus]] started brewing a potion from the [[Augury Root|Root]] that he gathered in the forest. [[Bill]] was scavenging around but all he could see were the visions created by the Tile, nothing tangible. As the Potion was brewing some burnable material from the vision fell into the flame causing an uncontrollable burn, which grew into a fire.

# Is that a Banana in your Helmet?
[[The Party]] noticed that, although it was an illusion the temperature started to rise quickly, which prompted a mad evacuation of the [[Burned-Out Tower|Tower]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] spiraled into a [[Rage]] for some unknown reason.
[[The Party]] rushed upstairs in order to rush downwards via the rope which [[Castle-8]] was still attempting to climb, [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] holding it in place. As he wasn't that far up he moved down again with ease.
[[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] went down the opposite side of [[Castle-8]], [[Enphine]] went on the side [[Castle-8]] was standing at. When [[Exilian]] tried to climb down on [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s side the rope snapped due to the pressure of the weight. [[Bill]] was lucky enough to climb the wall rather than the rope and avoided the fall.
[[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] rushed to one side to catch [[Exilian]]. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] plummeted to the ground and [[Enphine]] was impaled by [[Castle-8]]'s Horny-1. No further comments on the unfortunate situation will be accepted at this point.
[[Aboouck]] held his hands into the air, signaling to [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] to pick him up and fly him out of the tower, and so she did.
After [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]'s tantrum [[Rage|Raged]] on he also made it up the stairs and noticed the rope was gone. He looked to the side and saw [[Bill]] climbing down using the wall and decided to attempt to do the same. The wall however was brittle and couldn't hold the weight of [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]].
[[Castle-8]] pushed [[Enphine]] off his horn and healed her by using lay on hands. All was fine afterward, so [[The Party]] moved on.

# Murky Waters and Intrusive Beetles
[[The Party]] moved on to their original goal, the [[Skeletal Bridge]], where the light led them. When they arrived they were baffled by the size of the skeleton. They expected a bridge made out of bones, but the bridge turned out to be a skeleton itself, bridging some stinking waters.

Not trusting the situation [[The Party]] approached the skeleton with caution with [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] leading the way. When [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] climbed the skeleton a group of Beetles emerged and started moving towards him, but before they could do anything [[Bill]] put them to sleep with his [[Grass Whistle Blade]].
[[The Party]] had also noticed there was another purple tile on the back of the skeleton itself. [[Alaric]] was so furious about this sighting that he angrily rushed towards it to stamped on it.
The moment [[Alaric]] touched the tile a new vision appeared. The vision showed how [[Sylvanus]] was also chased by the Beetles. His cape caught on a protruding bone of the [[Skeletal Bridge|Bridge]] when fleeing, but he was able to ward them off with some kind of acidic fluid which he had in a vial. Afterwards he set up camp on the side of the river, rested for the night and moved on, taking the tent with him
While [[Alaric]] was on the tile another group of Beetles moved in to feast on him, digging into his skin. The same thing happened to [[Castle-8]] only the Beetles went under his plate as that was the softest entry point. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] faced a similar fate. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] turned into a [[Bear#Brown Bear|Bear]] and rushed off towards [[Alaric]], eating one of the Beetles that were bugging him.
[[The Party]] attempted to fight off the Beetles but all their attacks seemed useless, except for one acid arrow that [[Enphine]] fired. [[Alaric]] attempted to get rid of the Beetles by jumping into the stinking water, which seemed to work, the Beetles scattered off. [[Aboouck]], still mounted on [[Castle-8]]'s shoulders, cast a [[Reduce|Spell]] to change [[Alaric]] and [[Castle-8]] into mini-sized versions of themselves, by doing so he seemed to age rapidly, one would estimate by about 6 years. 
[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] flew in and picked up the cape which was left by [[Sylvanus]], then flew onwards towards [[Castle-8]] and emptied almost a whole bottle of acid which was obtained from the [[Giant Floating Pus Blob Monster]] back in the caves. It dealt quite some damage to [[Castle-8]] himself but also dissolved the Beetles entirely.
[[Exilian]] tried to cross the [[Skeletal Bridge]] by turning [[Invisible]]. The Beetles did seem to react to him but were unable to find him, allowing him to pass without any problems.
[[Enphine]] was curious as to how the skeleton felt to the touch, but fled into the water the moment she touched it and the Beetles crept out. She continued the rest of the journey through the water, puking her stomach contents out on the other side of the river bank.
Almost everyone was waiting on the other side of the river. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] was the only one left behind and was surrounded by hundreds of Beetles that seem to overwhelm him. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] flew over to him help out by blasting the majority of the Beetles by dropping a Horn of [[Gunpowder]]. It didn't seem to damage the Beetles, however it did blast them off into the water after which they scattered. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] jumped into the water to get rid of the last of them.
[[BIll]] and [[Exilian]] lagged behind and attempted to add their worth to the situation from a distance, but were eventually overwhelmed by the fumes of the stream. They decided to attempt to cross, avoiding the [[Skeletal Bridge]] for the most part, but [[Exilian]] scraped it slightly, attracting Beetles. He decided to sludge through the Stream the rest of the way.
After all were across, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] fixed up [[Enphine]], [[Exilian]] and [[Castle-8]]'s nauseous moods. With all the Beetles gone and everybody recovered, [[The Party]] was free to move on and followed the lights once more.

# Death and Decay Finds New Life
[[The Party]] arrived at a Circle of Stones deep within the dark [[Marrowgrove]]. They noticed there was a body located at the center of this ruin. Upon closer inspection they noticed it was the corpse of [[Sylvanus]] which had already started to decay quite significantly. [[The Party]] moved in, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] heading up front and knelt besides the body. Using detect magic he noticed that the place was surrounded by necrotic magic. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] moved on to touching the corpse. As soon as he did so roots started to surround coming up out of the mud and surrounded the corpse, turning it into a twisted tree-like creature.

[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] moved in first, hacking and slashing her way into the creature and doing a massive amount of damage. [[Aboouck]] followed by casting a the [[Blight]] Spell that did [[Necrotic Magic|Necrotic]] damage. The Creature however seemed to be made up of [[Necrotic Magic|Necrotic]] magic itself and seemed to regenerate roots on the places [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] had damaged it. The creature then moved on and grappled [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], moved into the ground and reappeared with [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] still in its roots behind [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] and [[Enphine]]. As he did so, a great puddle of mud appeared around [[Alaric]], [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] and [[Castle-8]], limiting their movement.

[[Alaric]] was able to free himself from the mud and moved in, seeing a tree-like creature he immediately thought that it and his lovely Greataxe would fit well together, cutting it apart and gaining the creature's attention. [[Aboouck]] told [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] and [[Castle-8]] to move it along and [[Haste|Hasted]] them, then jumped off to avoid dropping any additional organic surprises. [[Enphine]] cast a gigantic [[Fireball]] at the creature, which it brushed aside easily. [[Castle-8]] used his holy paladin's devotion in order to create a [[Crusader's Mantle|Radiant Aura]] which would help the rest of [[The Party]] in their battle. 
 
[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] once again moved in to show her fury and hacked and slashed away. [[Bill]] came in to finish the job. The creature sank down into the forest floor, dragging his grappled victims [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Alaric]] with it. [[Bill]] saw this, jumped straight towards the roots entangling [[Alaric]] and cut them loose. He also attempted to do so with the ones holding [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] but found out the damage of last week's Acid still had an effect on his left arm and was unsuccessful. [[Exilian]] jumped in and freed [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]. The creature sank into the floor but left behind the mangled corpse of [[Sylvanus]], letting out the word "Freedom".

[[The Party]] lifted the body onto [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] who had changed into a [[Bear#Brown Bear|Bear Form]] once more in order to transport it back to [[Mythana]]. The corruption seemed to be waning from the forest.
