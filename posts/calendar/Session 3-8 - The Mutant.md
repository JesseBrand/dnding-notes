[[The Party]], consisting ofÂ [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Castle-8]], [[Exilian]], [[Horatio]], [[Drathuul]] and [[Bavon]]:

- spent some time in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]], deciding what to do; noticed [[Exilian]] having trouble with his tab and [[Castle-8]] arriving with a huge amount of [[Starmetal]];
- decided to attempt to apprehend [[Reo Churner]], and asked around town for more information, among which [[Borout Bescond|Borout the Blacksmith]];
- watched [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] attempt to locate the [[Ship Bescond|Ship the Blacksmith's Son]]'s hammer, only for the spell to not work;
- left town and headed south towards [[Arken Fissure]], where they encountered an enraged [[Reo Churner]] across the chasm;
- engaged in conversation with [[Reo Churner|Reo]], hearing about his beef with the [[Duke Oakfire|Duke]] and his warnings about evil to the south-east;
- attempted to cross the [[Arken Fissure|Fissure]] anyway after [[Reo Churner|Reo]] headed off, with [[Castle-8]] and [[Bavon]] falling in;
- followed the [[Arken Fissure|Fissure]] west to find giant webs, where they were ambushed by some [[Troll|Trolls]] and [[Giant Spider|Giant Spiders]];
- taunted the [[Troll|Trolls]] in the [[Arken Fissure|Fissure]] but eventually decided not to engage and head south;
- followed the road to the [[Dread Wastelands]], camping in the wastelands along the way;
- arrived at the [[Dread Wastelands]] and witnessed a hoard of [[Gnoll|Gnolls]], deciding retreating was the better part of valor, and headed back towards the [[Arken Fissure|Fissure]];
- ran into an enraged [[Reo Churner]] that would not let them pass, engaging them in combat;
- grew more horrified as [[Reo Churner|Reo]] ingested vial after vial, mutating and growing more arms before their eyes;
- eventually subdued him and bound him to take him to [[Ebonwatch]]
- returned to the [[Ebonwatch|Town]] late at night, visiting the [[Duke Oakfire|Duke]] in the morning and collecting the bounty after turning [[Reo Churner|Reo]] in;
