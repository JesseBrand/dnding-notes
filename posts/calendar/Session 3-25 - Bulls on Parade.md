## Grumpy Old Man and fat ass [[Nuk]]
When looking around in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] a few things were soon obvious. There was a bar stool under a lot of strain trying to hold up [[Nuk]] who was eating away at a meal. By the looks of it, it wasn't his first of the day. Or the hour.
[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was clearly not in the mood, he was drawn into his own thoughts and anything that would interrupt these thoughts would be welcomed by a hearty grumble.
## No more Weighing us down
[[Enphine]], [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] and [[Horatio]] entered the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]]. Unlike [[Nuk]], [[Horatio]] seemed to not have something weighing him down anymore. He seemed to be the first of the three coming into the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]], actually. He was glad to announce that the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] helped him with his problem, which turned out to be the obsession he had with his [[Loadstone|Heavy Stone]].

## Escort at your Service
[[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] mentioned that he was offering escort service to the people needing to travel but afraid of facing the perils of the roads alone. He escorted them between the town and the outlying borrows. In the past he had encountered [[Demon|Demons]] appearing out of nowhere but this week he came across a sighting where a bunch of them came charging at him from a portal. He managed to overcome them, thanks to his incredible devotion, but was curious nonetheless and decided to step through the portal. He ended up with [[Enphine]] and [[Horatio]], who he heroically defended from another assault by [[Demon|Demons]] by employing his [[Spirit Guardians]]. He wondered if anyone else had also encountered something like this.
## Doubts about [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]
[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], being unaware what had happened last week was stunned by the sight of [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]]. She asked to [[The Party]] what had happened and what their thoughts on the situation were. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] claimed it was an unholy spawn to which [[Aboouck]] corrected him, that he was just a [[Fiend]] returning from the death which [[Castle-8]] was happy to confirm. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] was just silently trying to laugh it away and hoped the conversation would pass, which it did.

[[The Party]] discussed what to do next, but concluded rather quickly that they should continue to hunt down the [[Demon|Demons]] still left in the forest. ideas were brought up to return to [[Sir Dozak's Forward Camp]] but others suggested to just collect the bounty in one go. [[Castle-8]] was left behind due to his blunt actions the week before.
## Open Field of the Goats and Toads
[[The Party]] headed out, moving past several known locations to end up at the open field where they had encountered the [[Goat Demon|Goat Demons]] and the [[Frog Demon]]. Not trying to dawdle for to long they continued their journey into the forest.
## Three Caves, Six Horns
They reached a place, flanked by cliffs on both sides. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Bill]] snuck ahead and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] attempted to do the same, failing miserably. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] moved towards the entrance of one of the caves which were spotted. He noticed a creature with red glowing eyes charging out.
Three hideous [[Malformed Minotaur|Malformed Minotaurs]] came rushing out of the caves; They were out for blood and were thirsty for it; [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] pulled out his stunt with the bees again, to the great annoyance of the other members of [[The Party]]. Although according to [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], it seemed more useful this time  than before at splitting up the demons. [[Enphine]] hurled [[Fireball|Fireballs]], cold spells and [[Magic Missile|Magic Missiles]] around, dealing great amounts of damage. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] was swifter than ever dancing around and dodging all of the incoming attacks, pretty much all off them, but with his vigorous movements he was too off-balance to strike out many blows himself. He did however use his [[Booming Blade]] to great effect. [[Bill]] charged and retreated with great cunning, putting one of the big beasts to sleep. [[Aboouck]] nimbly jumped in and out of the bee swarm to encourage [[The Party]] with [[Haste]] and casting some pretty devastating [[Magic Missile|Magic Missiles]]. [[Horatio]] played around with his new mounted toy gun, having too much energy from [[Aboouck]]'s [[Haste]] and not knowing what to do with it. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] kept swooping in, stunning and attempting to stun the beasts. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] being in the wrong place at the wrong time received some hard blows and ended up slumping onto the floor unconsciously.

[[The Party]] succeeded with limited struggles and removed once against some demons from the shard making it a insignificant amount more peaceful.
## Angry Bears and Black Sacks
[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] tried to cut off some of the horns with his scimitar, to which [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] said it wasn't useful. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] replied with "Shut the hell up", ever grumpy as he was. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] was a lot more insightful though and noticed that the energy of the [[Demon|Demons]] could be harvested and transferred into items. [[Aboouck]] suggested to try it out on one of the stuffed animals he was carrying around. The effect of this experiment was that the [[Demonic Teddy Bear]] came alive, rather pesky and moody due to the energy obtained from demonic presence. Encouraged greatly by seeing the success, [[Aboouck]] mentioned he had more stuffed animals. Before anyone could provide helpful insights, the essences of the other two [[Demon|Demons]] were transferred into two additional [[Demonic Teddy Bear|Sentient Teddy Bears]].

The presence of the demonic items sparked [[Enphine]]'s intellect. She remembered she was carrying a black bag found at the [[Shadow Monster]] earlier. She mentioned that she had this checked out by the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] and that they were unable to open it up and said it was held by some strong magic. She did tell the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] indicated it could be worth a pretty penny.
## Shadow-Touched
Grumpy old man [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] moved on forward together with [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], intended to further follow the escaped [[Demon]]. They came across a big wall of [[Darkness]]. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] started to fly up, to see if she could see how far this [[Darkness]] spread, and saw a large blanket lying over the forest. They also experienced the sunlight was not as bright as it should have been, being the middle of the day. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] noticed a resemblance of this [[Shadow]] in the pain he felt from the [[Heart of the Forest]] and started to reach out to it. Luckily [[The Party]] had caught up by then. [[Bill]] looked on from a distance and saw how [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was being engulfed by the [[Shadow|Shadows]] and started rushing towards him, screaming out to not touch it and run away from it. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] turned towards [[Bill]] as he grabbed hold of his hand and said "This is what's hurting the forest", touching the black veil.

Immediately [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was pulled out by [[Bill]] who had an eerie feeling about the [[Darkness]] and started hiding behind a nearby rock. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] summoned a bunch of [[Giant Bee|Giant Bees]], but they were ignored by the [[Shadow|Shadows]] coming from the darkness who started attacking him. Every attack which hit him drained his strength, [[The Party]] could see how this weakened [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], trembling more and more, clinging onto his staff, dropping to his knees, and ending down on the ground unresponsive. [[Enphine]] levitated the body, after which [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] healed it and allowed for [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] to escape, then being carried away by [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] who healed him like he did to [[Bill]] earlier, with the words "May the forest be with you".
## On the Retreat
The whole [[The Party|Party]] managed to get away without too much damage. On their way back they saw that the [[Darkness]] had spread even further, trying to close them in, but they retreated just in time.

- 3 [[Demonic Teddy Bear|Sentient Teddy Bears]] ([[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]])
