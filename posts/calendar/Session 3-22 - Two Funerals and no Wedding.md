# Return to the Ground
At the end of the previous adventure a funeral was held for [[Sylvanus]], of [[The Party]] the following members were present: [[Bill]], [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Enphine]], [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], [[Aboouck]] and [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]].

At dawn the elves and the members of [[The Party]] that were present gathered in a clearing in the forest close to [[Mythana]]. [[Sylvanus]]' body was put in the center of this clearing. His body was surrounded by a circle of blue flowers. The forest was silent, the animals also felt a loss within the forest. 
[[Tyderius]] asked how he came to pass. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] explained that some for of corruption overtook him and turned him into some kind of rooted monster, to which [[Bill]] replied that he was corrupted. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] explained his last actions, how [[Sylvanus]] tried to make a potion to see into the future, and showed the root that was used as the main ingredient in the potion. [[Tyderius]] replied saying "It is up to you to decide if you want to continue this work or not".

[[Tyderius]] spoke and told those present about the gap [[Sylvanus]] would now leave in the community and in the forest. He said the [[Heart of the Forest]] was now without a guardian, which peaked [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]'s curiosity. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] asked if he could take [[Sylvanus]]' place as guardian, to which [[Tyderius]] replied that the forest itself would be the one to decide that, and he should visit the [[Sylvanus' Cabin|Cabin of Sylvanus]].

The ceremony started and the elves started chanting a song. As this was happening [[Sylvanus]]' body was returning to the earth, as roots were entangling his body, pulling his body deeper and deeper into the ground. What remained was a single branch. [[Tyderius]] walked up to the branch and picked it up, and told the members of [[The Party]] that as thanks they could have this staff. [[Enphine]] walked up and accepted the gift and said they were very grateful.

# Huh, Nuk ???
After returning to [[Ebonwatch]], [[The Party]] split up again. During the week [[Enphine]] went back to the [[Sootwall Observatory|Observatory]] and came across [[Nuk]] in the dining area. She asked him for some gold in order to purchase a pearl, so that she could start identifying items. [[Nuk]] said he was willing to lend it to her.
With this [[Enphine]] was able to identify the staff and found out it was a [[Staff of Beekeeping]].

# Bears on Crystal
Later that week [[Aboouck]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] were in the kitchen, they were talking about making a cake for [[Sir Dixon Fire|Dixon]]'s' 70th birthday and as a payment [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] gave [[Aboouck]] a crystal he had found in the caves earlier. [[Aboouck]] took the crystal and stuffed it up a stuffed animal's behind resulting in it starting to fly and coming alive. The bear flew into the common room and as [[Alaric]] was startled the bear flew straight towards him. [[Aboouck]] tried to chase the bear, but it had lost its magic before it reached [[Alaric]], plummeting into the ground in front of him.
[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] came out of the kitchen and stood next to [[Florellius Patar]] who warned him not to go into the kitchen again in the future.

# Supper First
At the beginning of the adventure day [[Aboouck]] served four of [[Exilian]]'s' eggs which [[Exilian]], [[Castle-8]], [[Alaric]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] were having for breakfast. The egg didn't seem to favor [[Exilian]] and [[Castle-8]] very well, and knocked them far back off their seats. Nobody seemed to care about what happened to [[Castle-8]]. [[Exilian]] got some first aid from [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]; [[Alaric]] suddenly got more intelligent and knew the answer to the question of what 1 + 2 was. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] got more wise, learning from events in the past and applying this to situations in the future. If only he knew what was in store for him...

Afterwards [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] asked to bring out the cake which [[Aboouck]] made, [[Aboouck]] ran back into the kitchen and started making up something, with a lot of racket coming out of the kitchen. He showed up with brownies containing mushrooms. [[Alaric]] was the first to take a bite, and suddenly he vanished. The rest of [[The Party]] was stunned by what happened, but it didn't seem to do much to impress them. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] took a 2nd bite and soon more followed. [[Alaric]] was the only one to disappear. Nobody being surprised by what happened they quickly decided to continue and resolve the problems in the quarry, hoping [[Alaric]] would follow unseen.

# House of Dragons
[[The Party]] arrived at the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] and found a dark fog hanging around it. [[The Party]] moved in and noticed they could barely convey messages from one to another as hardly anyone could hear nor see anything. [[Enphine]] and [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] stayed behind to start up a ritual to detect what kind of magic this fog was, but also to find out if [[Alaric]] joined with [[The Party]] towards the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]]. Everyone moved on down into the pit and was waiting for [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] and [[Enphine]] to rejoin at the entrance. after the ritual was finished they descended but didn't see anything special about the fog. However, [[Alaric]] did seem to glow up.

[[The Party]] moved in, trying to find their way through the cave and ended up in one of the main caves. suddenly they heard a voice speaking, threatening them. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was provoked by this voice saying they had come to kill them. [[Alaric]] tried to quietly, but also invisible move towards where the sound came from, but made a lot of [[Alaric]] noises doing so.

[[Nivrath]] the Sapphire [[Dragon]] moved in on [[The Party]] , confronting [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] with his behaviour, after which he apologized. Then [[Essephy]] the Emerald [[Dragon]] showed up, calming down those present and explaining about the dire situation before them. [[Nivrath]] explained how they wouldn't go down into the depths since they wouldn't risk their young being hurt or left alone.
[[Nivrath]] opened up a hole in the ground saying this was where the darkness was, and that they sometimes escape from it. Both [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and, the still invisible [[Alaric]] jumped down after which [[The Party]] followed somewhat more gently.

# Shady Entrance
As they reached the bottom the whole party saw a big area of [[Darkness]] where no light would penetrate. Only [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] was able to see into it, noticing all kinds of [[Shadow|Shadowy Creatures]]. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] started to cast [[Daylight]] on his shield. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] noticed shadowy images coming out of the walls around him which promptly vanished as the [[Daylight]] spell took effect, resulting in [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] questioning his sanity.

[[The Party]] decided to engage with the creatures in the [[Darkness]], dealing quite some damage and dispersing the creatures only to see them form back within the [[Darkness]]. [[The Party]] decided to disengage and move on. They moved on through the cave seeing and avoiding patches of [[Darkness]] everywhere as they moved along. Hearing flapping sounds of wings [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] noticed flying creatures of [[Shadow]] within the [[Darkness]] as well, until they reached a large room filled with [[Darkness]] where they couldn't continue.

# Can they get any bigger?
As [[The Party]] inspected the large patch of [[Darkness]], there seemed to be something different about this one. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] noticed something strange in between those [[Shadow]] monsters, something the other areas didn't have. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] felt watched. When he peered into the [[Darkness]] he felt he saw a gigantic [[Shadow]] monster that looked a bit like [[Alaric]]: The same red eyes and a similar posture, only slightly bigger. Massive. The creature rose from the [[Darklake]] and towered above it! It also sent a message to [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], indicating he was doomed. Then it started attacking [[The Party]].

[[Bill]] was first to move, rushing into the [[Darkness]]. It would be a while before the rest of [[The Party]] would receive any word from him. The creature sent out some necrotic wave towards [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], scaring him out of his wits then causing him to run the other way and covering the back. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] ran into the [[Darkness]] trying to save [[Bill]] as he saw he was downed. [[Enphine]] cast a [[Wall of Fire]] to through the creature and shot two [[Fireball|Fireballs]] at him. [[Aboouck]] cast [[Haste]] on a hesitant [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] and [[Alaric]], creating a magic shield around himself. [[Aboouck]] then fired a bunch of [[Magic Missile|Magic Missiles]], causing an accidental [[Fog Cloud]]. [[Alaric]] hack and slashed his way into the [[Shadow Monster]] and required only a couple of turns to kill it. [[Exilian]] was shooting one arrow after the other at the [[Shadow]]. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] was setting up [[Spirit Guardians]] and dropping them soon after. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] was able to save [[Bill]], only to die a heroic death as the life was sucked out of him by the [[Shadow Monster]] just before it was extinguished.

# A Dark Day
As the monster was killed the dust settled and the real damage to the world became visible. A hero trying to fight the demons in the world, fighting for what was truly just in this world had seen his end, trying to fight a [[Darkness]] and saving others at the same time. This became too much for him and he was unable to keep the [[Darkness]] of the shadow at bay, and they consumed him. a rotten darkness festered in a heart that was already damaged by his past and now had to suffer an extra blow which it could not handle anymore. [[The Party]] was devastated by this and shed tears for losing a brethren. They carried his body outside, to give him a proper goodbye, one only fit for such a great and undervalued hero by society.

# A Hasty Retreat
As [[The Party]] carried [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s broken body outside, [[Enphine]] noticed a container of shadowy material left behind by the [[Shadow Monster]] which she picked up. As she studied it [[The Party]] became aware of the danger they were still in and hurried back to the entrance. On their way back they noticed more and more increasingly dangerous looking [[Shadow Monster|Shadow Monsters]] in the patches of [[Darkness]]. They increased their step further and quickly retreated back to the relative safety of the [[Dragon|Dragons]]' presence.
