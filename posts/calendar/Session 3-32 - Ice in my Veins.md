## The Usual Shenanigans
After the usual struggles, discussions and conflicts occurring at [[Black Barrel Inn]], [[The Party]] decided to once again head for the [[Giant Crater Covered in Ice]] and explore it further.

[[The Party]] headed out past [[Hornwood]] and returned to the [[Royal Woodlands]], past the [[Burned Forest]] towards the [[Giant Crater Covered in Ice|Ice Crater]].

After traversing through the [[Burned Forest]], they arrived at the edge of the [[Giant Crater Covered in Ice|Crater]]. To their surprise, the ice was expanding, crawling up the rim of the [[Giant Crater Covered in Ice|Crater]].

[[The Party]] descended the icy wall of the [[Giant Crater Covered in Ice|Crater]] gracefully (for a change). That is, all except [[Enphine]]. As the rest of [[The Party]] reached the bottom, they were witness to her diving down the ridge head-first, severely injuring her.
## Exploring the Icy Wastes
The [[Giant Crater Covered in Ice|Ice Crater]] narrowed towards the north, where they noticed the entrance to an [[Ice Cave]] further ahead, with a large legion of [[Zombie|Zombies]] guarding the entrance. [[The Party]] moved in to engage. There appeared to be some more advanced [[Zombie]] types among them. Some were huge and lumbering, some were quite fast to move and some appeared to be bloated, filled with oozing liquids ready to pour out.

At some point [[Enphine]] was able to throw a [[Fireball]] into their midst. The bloated [[Zombie|Zombies]] ignited and soon after detonated, causing havoc in both their ranks and [[The Party]]. The more perceptive amongst them noticed glowing eyes watching them from within the [[Ice Cave]].

## Into the Cold
As the [[[Zombie|Zombies]] lay dead and the battlefield was littered with exploding [[Zombie]] parts, [[The Party]] approached the [[Ice Cave]] entrance. Inside the temperature dropped severely. It was clear the unnatural icy temperatures originated from here.

They noticed a small plateau with strange symbols on it in a room off to the left, which some of them explored as others headed deeper inside. A [[Spiked Collar]] lay on the stones, which was taken. Further along, the sounds of pickaxes on ice was audible. As a part of the party investigated, they came upon a ice barrier that was being worked on from underneath. A large group of [[Ghoul|Ghouls]] and [[Undead Archers]] on top of it noticed them and proceeded to engage them.

[[The Party]] used the bottleneck of the tunnel to their advantage, but were unable to break through. [[Horatio]], as his intelligent self, tried a daring maneuver. He [[Catapult|Catapulted]] his backpack, filled with [[Alchemist Fire]] and [[Flask of Acid|Flasks of Acid]] towards the monsters, who swiftly dodged it. It hit the wall behind them, shattering, spreading molten gold all over the place. It was then [[Horatio]] realized his [[Portable Hole]] was in that bag. They were unable to retrieve it as they were pushed back.

Suddenly a group of [[Undead]] appeared at the stone plateau in the left room they noticed before. [[Lynel]], [[Castle-8]] and [[Enphine]], who stayed behind to investigate were unpleasantly surprised. Among the [[Undead Archers]] was a [[Demilich]] with [[Demilich Eyes|Crystal Eyes]] who seemed to command the rest of the [[Undead]].

The battle was heavy, and [[The Party]] retreated from the encounter at the ice barrier. The [[Undead Archers]] drained the life from several brave warriors as their arrows and the [[Demilich]] rained havoc. [[The Party]] almost lost the fight, but through the strategic use of a [[Wall of Fire]] by [[Enphine]], grabbing the [[Demilich]] within a [[Bedroll]] by [[Lynel]] and an amazing crushing blow from [[Castle-8]], they managed to overcome the [[Demilich]]. They hastily withdrew back to [[Ebonwatch]] before more [[Undead]] would come their way.
