# Making an Oath
The day started off where most of [[The Party]] was present inside the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] walked up to [[Castle-8]] to ask him if he had heard of [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s demise. [[Castle-8]] acknowledged, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] then showed him the [[Dragon's Wrath Glaive|Glaive]], on which [[Chamberlain Gerrard]] replied that that would be a great [[Dragon's Wrath Glaive|Glaive]] to cut off some [[Troll]] heads. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] asked if [[Castle-8]] would want to continue [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s legacy of hunting [[Demon|Demons]] using this [[Dragon's Wrath Glaive|Glaive]] to which [[Castle-8]] agreed.

[[Castle-8]] was overwhelmed by a blasting roar when he took the [[Dragon's Wrath Glaive|Glaive]] and experienced a dark presence. Reacting to this [[Castle-8]] put his ear to it and started seeing a vision, he saw the [[Nivrath|Blue Dragon]] as it turned his head towards [[Castle-8]], but vanished behind a shroud of [[Darkness]],  ending the vision. It left [[Castle-8]] spooked.

# Bright light
At that point, [[Enphine]] and surprisingly [[Nuk]] walked in. [[Nuk]] seemed a little twitchy and seemed to barely have recovered. Unlike most people who are taken into care he seemed to have gained quite some weight. [[The Party]] started discussing what they were going to do that day. As [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] seemed to be missing, [[Enphine]] mentioned that it would be a hard task to return to the quarry without the [[Daylight]] spell. [[Nuk]] instantly reacted to it "[[Daylight]]? [[DAYLIGHT]]? I can cast [[Daylight]]" and just like that [[Nuk]] cast [[Daylight]] on his [[Special Doll of the Warmage +1|Special Doll]]. What was once a black doll instantly turned out to create such a bright light that most of the people in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] had to cover their eyes.

Most noticeably was [[Bill]] who started screeching that the light was hurting his eyes and he started shielding himself from it. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] jumped in front of [[Bill]] and shielded him from the bright light as much as possible. [[Bill]] said he would rather wait outside as he couldn't stand the light and thus he and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] both went outside. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Alaric]] also decided to wait outside till this whole ordeal was over.

[[Florellius Patar|Florellius]] shouted around that, the person who would be able to turn off the bright light would get a free ale. [[Horatio]], tempted by the offer, started to open up his [[Eversmoking Bottle]], but this didn't have the desired effect, and thus he closed it again, leaving quite some smoke in the tavern.
Reacting to [[Florellius Patar|Florellius]], [[Castle-8]] tried to see if a small tap on [[Nuk]]'s already messed up head would help, it didn't seem to help out.

[[Nuk]] noticed the confusion he was causing with his bright light and decided to hide this [[Special Doll of the Warmage +1|Special Doll]] under his robes, but not quickly enough before [[Horatio]] was able to grab hold of the doll. After a wild struggle [[Horatio]] was able to steal the doll which made [[Nuk]] even more upset than he already was. [[Nuk]] started attacking [[Horatio]] because he took his doll, but [[Horatio]] had already thrown the doll into his [[Portable Hole]]. Surprised by the crazy mood [[Nuk]] went in he decided to climb into his [[Portable Hole]] in order to take the doll out again and give it back.

The guards were less than amused by [[Horatio]] and [[Nuk]], first creating smoke and then starting a brawl, and thus they asked them to leave the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]].

# Where do we go next?
As the whole party gathered outside they continued arguing for a reasonable amount of time on where to go next. Many suggestions came by before they settled for the destination of visiting the [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarves]].

[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] told [[The Party]] that she wanted to pick up her barrel of dwarven ale as they planned to go there anyway. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Castle-8]] hoisted the barrel into [[Horatio]]'s [[Portable Hole]] and [[The Party]] set off. 

# White Goo
[[The Party]] decided to travel to the [[Dwarven Mining Camp]] as nobody really knew the direction towards [[Moldarhim]]. [[The Party]] tried their best trying not to get distracted and was even able to pass a bridge of water at [[Hornwood]] without too much dicking about. However, their what would be a swift journey got interrupted by some white goo that was oozing out of the ground in the middle of the road. [[The Party]] was hesitant on what to do next, however as [[Castle-8]] was interested and decided to approach it and decided to touch it. When approaching the ground started to cave in and open up. [[Castle-8]] plummeted down, only to be confronted by a bunch of [[Minotaur|Minotaurs]].

[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Alaric]] and [[Bill]] quickly jumped, climbed or flew down to aid [[Castle-8]] down below. This all went quite swiftly, hacking and slashing a [[Greataxe]], poking with a magical [[Starmetal Quarterstaff|Quarterstaff]], swinging pointy daggers around and [[Fireball|Fireballs]] being hurled from above. This made quick work of the situation. One of the [[Minotaur|Minotaurs]] burst up from the ground creating a new entrance to the cavern, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] reacted to this by using his [[Staff of Beekeeping|Staff]] to summon a swarm of bees, obscuring the area and annoying a great deal of [[The Party]] by doing so.

Even though the battle went smooth it was far from over

# Bigger
Bigger, badder and stronger demons were climbing up from the depths of the pit below and charged straight for [[The Party]]. The raging roars of [[Alaric]] and the flares shining off his [[Starmetal Greataxe|Greataxe]] made him a target for these creatures. They charged down on him dealing severe damage, and almost knocked him down, were it not for his [[Orcish Fury]] and [[Boon of Recovery]].

This would not last however and [[Alaric]] was downed nonetheless, his fall and the increasing threat scared [[The Party]], and they started an evacuation of the members who were on the lower levels. [[Castle-8]] brought [[Alaric]] back to consciousness so that he could also flee. many attempts were made to try and hold back any further [[Demon|Demons]] from climbing out of the depths, [[Grease]] was smudged on the floor and ledges, an [[Ice Storm]] was created to make things slippery. [[Giant Bee|Giant Bees]] were sent down in order to assist in the retreat. [[The Party]] made it out of the cave, but the [[Demon|Demons]] were in hot pursuit.

# MAKE IT STOP!
The bigger [[Demon|Demons]] followed [[The Party]] outside as they had tasted their flesh now. Relentlessly they continued on hacking down on [[The Party]]. The attacks became too much for both [[Alaric]] and [[Bill]] and they lost consciousness and fell down to the ground. [[Bill]] seemed to hit the ground harder than [[Alaric]] and was bleeding heavily, sadly not many saw this as he was covered by the bees of [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]].

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Castle-8]], who were still surrounding the entrance of the cave felt a significant heat coming from inside the hole as loud roars were heard from down below, a bad sign. [[Castle-8]] tried to seal the hole by using his [[Thunderous Smite]] on the edge of the entrance but blinded by the bees, ended up hitting his own toes twice and tumbling over.

Meanwhile, [[Horatio]] decided to [[Vortex Warp]] himself out of there as soon as possible, which triggered the mass retreat of [[The Party]] on the higher ground. [[Nuk]] attempted to cover up the entrances as [[Demonic Birds]] were dashing out, but with little and increasing paranoia he grabbed on to [[Enphine]] and [[Thunder Step|Thunder Stepped]] out of there. [[Enphine]] still tried to do some extra damage from afar as much as possible by casting [[Magic Missile]] and other spells but the big baddies seemed to have a high tolerance. [[Horatio]], from even further back summoned a [[Force Ballista]] and shot that at one of the [[Demon|Demons]] which caused it to tumble down back into the hole.

Shortly after [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] flew up and threw a lit [[Horn of Gunpowder]] into the cave, causing it to collapse, yielding loud roars from the [[Demon|Demons]] within. Seeing how this worked very effectively she also did this to the other entrance closing that too. Before the caves collapsed [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] were able to look inside, noticing more increasingly large and deadly looking [[Demon|Demons]] emerging from the depths.

With the cavern closed there was only one huge [[Demon]] remaining. Surrounded by the bees and with several people down, the battle was very confusing and unorganized. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] poured a [[Potion of Healing]] down [[Bill]]'s throat, springing him back to life and moved on to [[Alaric]]. Too furious to concentrate on a spell [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was only able to do a medicine check on [[Alaric]], stabilizing him and screamed for help from [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]]. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] dropped down to help out [[Alaric]]. Not strong enough he opened up a [[Potion of Giant Strength#Hill Giant|Potion of Hill Giant Strength]], which bulked her up into something unnaturally strong, able to carry out [[Alaric]]'s body.

Close to defeat [[The Party]] retreated into the forest and moved to the [[Mythana]], leaving the [[Demon]] rampaging throughout the surroundings. Once there they healed [[Alaric]] back up.
