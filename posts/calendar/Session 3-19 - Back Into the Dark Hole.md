# Whatever happened last time?
Part of [[The Party]] had gathered in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] excluding [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], [[Bill]] and [[Enphine]]. A discussing was started as to what had happened on the previous encounter where the big [[Fireball]] explosion had happened.
[[Aboouck]] explained that this was caused by [[Exilian]] and that he was the reason it was such a devastating encounter and that they should not physically touch each other in the future anymore. This sounded like a feasible reason, [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] directly accepted this without any questions.

# What ever happened to that [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]]?
[[The Party]] present in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] decided to launch a mission towards the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]]. They were curious what the current state was and wanted to prevent the [[Shadow]] problem growing out of hand.
However there was one problem still, part of [[The Party]] was still missing and thus needed to be contacted. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] came up with a [[Sending|Spell]] he had which allowed him to contact someone he knows from incredible distance, but it was limited to 25 words.
They decided to contact the other part of [[The Party]]. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] started targeting [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and sent out the message which went something like this 

> 
> We want to go to the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] and fight the [[Shadows]]. Please come over, if you have a better idea let us know.
> 

Upon receiving this message [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] was startled which influenced most of the reply message which was something like:

> 
> Huh? Wha? What is this? who is this? [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]]? Where are you? What is this? No bad idea, come here, we need help!
> 

[[Enphine]] and [[Bill]], also in [[Mythana]], noticed this confusion of [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and asked him what was going on. He explained that it was [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] trying to contact them and that he asked them to come back to [[Ebonwatch]].
[[Enphine]] endorsed this idea, however [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] quickly replied it was a bad idea as the [[Heart of the Forest]] was degrading again and that it was at a tipping point of either recovering or being destroyed along with the [[Tebinor|Shard]] if [[The Party]] didn't do anything

# Other Side of the Call
Back in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] was confused by the reply he got from [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and was worried about him being struck by a stroke. at this point [[Brannis Boulderblade|Brannis]] also arrived in the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]] and seated herself at the table where [[The Party]] was at, she took [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]]'s drink and chucked it down. 
Afterwards she announced that she wanted to go back to her kin as the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Mine]] which [[The Party]] was talking about didn't contain the [[Adamantine]] ore they were looking for.
[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] proposed that she would join in if they could supply her with the ingredients for the secret recipe for [[Dwarven Ale]], [[Brannis Boulderblade|Brannis]] mentioned they wouldn't share the recipe for the [[Dwarven Ale]] but [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] corrected her by saying she already knew the recipe and only needed the ingredients.

# On our Way we Go
The larger part of [[The Party]] traveled towards [[Mythana]] in order to regroup with the intent to head to the [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]] afterwards. [[Alaric]] didn't want to deal with the [[Elf|Elves]] and thus offered to bring [[Brannis Boulderblade|Brannis]] to encampment and meet [[The Party]] there.
[[The Party]] then went to [[Mythana]] to regroup with [[Enphine]] and [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]. [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] wanted to rush towards [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] seeing if he actually was in trouble but was quickly halted by [[Myacine]] who reminded [[The Party]] that they were allowed here as guests and shouldn't overstay their welcome.
[[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] finally managed to make his way past [[Myacine]] and reached [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] to see he wasn't suffering from a stroke and he was ok.

# Who is this Guy?
[[The Party]] noticed there was a new person in [[Mythana]], a little green [[Goblin]]. [[The Party]] was stunned. They asked [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] who this was, who answered "What him? Don't you recognize [[Bill]]? Yeah, he is a bit green now, but he is still the same person that has always been with us".
[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] challenged [[Bill]] to prove himself and throw a dagger at her. [[Bill]] was a bit stunned at first  about this request and asked if she was sure. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] nodded, said "It will be fine". Thus [[Bill]] grabbed a dagger and flung it with amazing speed towards [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]]. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] tried to catch it and did so successfully but at the cost of getting some cuts in her hand due to the stunning throw of [[Bill]].

# Picking Up the Big Half-Green Friend
[[The Party]] decided to move on and went to the [[Dwarven Mining Camp]] to pick up [[Alaric]]. They passed by the [[Pixie|Pixies]] and were warned once again not to hurt any innocent creatures.
They stopped by the [[Dwarven Mine]] to see the [[Tebinor Dwarves|Dwarves]] were digging again. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] shouted that they should mine elsewhere as the problem wasn't with the ore they mined but the location they were mining. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] asked if the [[Sylvanus|Green Guy]] came by again to fight them; they replied it was nothing a pickaxe or a hammer couldn't solve.
Entering the [[Dwarven Mining Camp]] they came across [[Thyrim Stouthammer]] again which almost led to another drinking contest but [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] quickly explained she just wanted some ingredients when all of this was over. [[Alaric]] came out of the hut and rejoined [[The Party]] after which they moved on to continue on their quest to save [[Sylvanus]].

# The [[Cave of Cleansing Waters|Dark Cave]], Back and There Again
[[The Party]] returned to the [[Cave of Cleansing Waters]] where they had fought the [[Giant Floating Pus Blob Monster]] before when  [[Bill]] came up with the idea to first scout ahead before just rushing in, so [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and [[Bill]] went in front in order to scout ahead, one more elegant than the other. [[Bill]]'s search resulted into a dead end while [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] found an [[Desecrated Altar]] up on a ridge and a eerie cave leading down.
Meanwhile, [[Aboouck]] was staring into a waterfall that he believed was talking to him. He attempted to talk back, seemingly leading to a ripple in the water. [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] went to the [[Desecrated Altar]] together with [[Castle-8]] and started looking into boxes. When opening the boxes [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] noticed there was something curious about the boxes, but it disappeared as fast as the box was opening. [[Castle-8]] decided to smash one box to see if it would reveal its contents.
As this was happening the rest of [[The Party]] started moving. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] yelled out and was greeted by a couple of creatures emerging from their caves.

# Mole Ambush
The walls started trembling as [[The Party]] started to prepare for battle as [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Alaric]] descended a small cliff and headed out towards the front, going into a [[Rage]].
Not long after 3 [[Bulette|Mole-Like Creatures]] bursted out of the walls, leaping up onto the two and smashing them around. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Alaric]] didn't seem to be very impressed by the creatures and stood their ground.
[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] kept moaning not to hurt the moles but couldn't prevent all [[The Party]] members from attacking. Not long after a spirit of [[Sylvanus]] appeared and became the new target of most of [[The Party]] members.

At the same time a [[Shadow]] appeared near the ripple in the water and turned towards [[Horatio]], but was quickly dealt with by one hit of [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s mighty [[Dragon's Wrath Glaive|Glaive]].

On the other end of the fight [[Aboouck]] started shooting [[Magic Missile|Magic Missiles]] at the spirit of [[Sylvanus]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] changed into a [[Giant Spider]] and tried to [[Web]] [[Sylvanus]], which passed straight through him. [[Castle-8]] finished the job by double smiting down on [[Sylvanus]] making him disappear into nothingness.

# Splitting the Party again
Part of [[The Party]] decided to go back up towards the [[Desecrated Altar]] and investigate, finding out the boxes were tampered with by [[Illusion Magic]], while the [[Desecrated Altar|Altar]] was influenced by [[Necrotic Magic]]. [[Aboouck]] attempted to use [[Knock]] on the boxes, which resulted in a voice saying "not like this" coming from both further down the cave and in [[Aboouck]]'s head itself.
[[The Party]] decided to [[Dispel Magic|Dispel]] the boxes. Two [[Dispel Magic|Dispels]] by [[Ru Eir Hydrus|Ru]] and one by [[Enphine]] revealed a big sum of gold.

At the same time [[Bill]], [[Horatio]], [[Castle-8]] and [[Alaric]] moved further down the cave to face the Spirit of [[Sylvanus]] once more. [[Horatio]] started off the conversation with a [[Fire Bolt]] after which the Spirit of [[Sylvanus]] replied, telling him to stop it. It then started up the conversation that they spared the creatures, reacting very surprised and asking them why they did this, since he did not expect it to be in their nature.
[[Bill]] explaining there was some sort of corruption and that [[Sylvanus]]'s [[Tebinor Elves|Elvish Friends]] were worried about him. [[Sylvanus]] explained that there might still be hope for them yet, and told them to retrace his footsteps to see what he had seen. He held out a note before disappearing into thin air again. On the note was the following text:

> 
> When I drank of the augury root, I saw that my sacred grove would become corrupted, just like the marrowgrove in which I stood. I knew I could never recover from such a vision.
>

After which the spirit of [[Sylvanus]] disappeared, [[Alaric]] picked up the note noticed a wooden board which had vines growing over them and recognized it as a Shield. [[Horatio]] inspected it and found out it was best suited for someone who could [[Wild Shape]]. It was a [[Silverleaf Oaken Shield]]. [[Alaric]] asked if he could be the one to give it to [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] to clear up some muddy water which was between them.
Searching further they didn't find anything, but noticed a light [[Sylvanus]] apparently left behind for them to follow. The trail of lights led out of the cave, but the group regrouped with the rest of [[The Party]] before leaving.

# Unholy bindings released
[[Horatio]] was asked to pack up some of the crates the other group had found which [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] explained contained gold. This was fitted in [[Horatio]] [[Portable Hole]]. Both [[Enphine]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] attempted to separate the demonic influence from the [[Desecrated Altar|Altar]] from the original druidic intents.
Under [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]'s guidance they focused their magical energies into the altar. The cave started to tremble. A magic circle appeared on the ground which [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] recognized as a [[Banishment|Banishing]] and binding magic, everyone rapidly jumping off. Soon after a [[Huge Gorilla-like Demon]] looking like a giant gorilla appeared before flashing away again, leaving the [[Desecrated Altar|Altar]] cleansed. On it appeared a green dagger with a blade like grass. [[Horatio]] Identified the dagger and explained it was a [[Grass Whistle Blade]] and could lull enemies to sleep. He proclaimed that in honor of previous discussion it would be best to be given to someone who could uses daggers, and thus it ended up with [[Bill]]. Several party members were thrown completely off guard by this sudden change of behavior in [[Horatio]].

# Shiny Light, Where Art Thy?
[[The Party]] continued to follow the glowing green light outside the cave and slowly travelled east. After an hour and a half they noticed the forest slightly, cleared up a bit ahead. The lights led them to the edge of a devastated forest which seemed to evil, dark and dangerous. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] sent out a familiar to scout the forest for up to 2 hours to gain more insights in what was happening in the forest. [[The Party]] concluded the quest for the day and headed back out of the [[Heart of the Forest]], before heading their own ways.
