## Wait, is that [[Exilian]]?
After about a season of absence [[Exilian]] got up from his chair in the tavern last week, and when he came back his goatee had grown out a bit, his hair was way longer, and he had moss growing on his shoulders.
After being surprised by [[Exilian]], [[The Party]] chatted up a bit on what happened last week. People were having strange dreams about a long-lost time and other stuff happening. [[The Party]] then started talking about where to venture forth.
The [[Ice Cave]] with [[Undead]] they went to last time, that still contained [[Horatio]]'s gold? Nah, too dangerous.
The place within the [[Shadows]] where the [[Demon|Demonic]] [[Avatar of Slaughter|Avatars of Slaughter]] were harvested for the cursed [[Demonic Teddy Bear|Teddy Bears]] [[The Party]] had? Maybe... They would have to go back to the cave where the [[Shadow]] army was spotted the first time on the [[Tebinor|Shard]]… nah, more pressing matters to attend too!

## The Society Welcomes You!
Nope, no uncursing [[Enphine]]'s [[Demonic Teddy Bear|Teddy Bear]], because who could forget our dearest dear friend [[Ian]]! Always inviting us to visit his place, where his friends from [[The Society]] are!
[[Ian]] seemed to be more willing to converse when he heard that [[The Party]] actually wanted to go with him, rather than the ever lasting "[[The Sociaty]] Welcomes You" phrase he normally chanted; now there was a "Follow me" in there.
[[The Party]] followed [[Ian]] to the [[Anorak Iron Mine]], where his two friends were too. They seemed to be in pretty much the same state as [[Ian]] was in. However dull [[Ian]]'s gaze was; he did manage to swiftly climb a wooden barricade without too much trouble, for an old brainwashed fellow. He then shouted to [[The Party]] to follow him in.
## Which stairs did we come from and which do we go to?
When reaching the whirlpool area of the cave, he pointed [[The Party]] onwards towards the cave they knew all to well. This was where they fought the [[Troglodytes]] so long ago. [[The Party]] asked whether [[Ian]] wanted to accompany them into the stream. He replied with "[[The Society]] waits for you further down", and thus [[The Party]] moved on without him, such a great host for a party in his own home.
[[The Party]] went forth all the way down into the place they left so long ago. Within the submerged stairs, [[The Party]] looked at each other, determining who would go in first, and quickly all eyes looked towards the machine who didn't need to swim, as he was so heavy he would stick to the floor. The one, if caught off guard, would be able to take a hit.
[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] would join in as a [[Giant Toad]], and [[Exilian]] who had a [[Ring of Swimming]] which in some kind of unexplained way bestowed him the ability to swim…
![[sessions/3-34/drow-gasp.webp]]  
As both [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and [[Castle-8]] didn't need to go up for air they weren't in a real rush to get out of the water, unlike [[Exilian]]. He burst forth towards the first air bubble he could see. Whilst bursting out of the water, spewing and gasping for air, the wet [[Drow]] was spotted by some [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] who immediately started to attack him in that narrow entryway. [[Castle-8]] tried to help out but was unable to pass both [[Exilian]] and the [[Troglodyte]], and he readied his weapon to attack whenever he would get the opportunity. They noticed the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] were engaged in a fight with several [[Lizardfolk]], but were quickly getting the upper hand.

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] noticed they might be outnumbered here and went out to get the rest, coming up in the form of a [[Giant Toad]] and making himself ridiculous trying to convey his message to the rest of [[The Party]]. [[Horatio]] decided not to understand and sat back. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] grabbed [[Castle-8]]'s [[Pikachu|Skeletal Dog]], now named [[Pikachu]] and jumped in, as [[Bill]] and [[Enphine]] jumped onto the [[Giant Toad]] to piggyback with him underwater.
[[Horatio]] waited for a while, then touched the water with a toe and with a deep sigh, finally decided to follow.
![[sessions/3-34/Toad-squeeze.webp]]  
The portion of [[The Party]] that went down into the water with the [[Giant Toad]] released when they hit the bottom chamber. [[Bill]] threw his [[Black Star]] towards the nearest [[Troglodyte]], killing him right after [[Exilian]] managed to get away and [[Castle-8]] hitting him with a powerful blow, all this downing the [[Troglodyte]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] saw this as an opportunity to get himself into an impossible situation again and tried to squeeze through the narrow crevice, but then got stuck. Turns out [[Giant Toad|Giant Toads]] don't seem so nimble on land as they are in water.
[[Castle-8]], annoyed by [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] blocking the road ahead once more, just forcefully pushed him through, and started then hacking down the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]].
The rest of [[The Party]] came through chopping down and setting ablaze the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]]. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] went around healing the [[Lizardfolk]] back up.

## They Brought a Cave [[Troll]]glodyte
![[sessions/3-34/Troglodyte.webp]]  
Event though the danger in this room seemed over, [[The Party]] noticed noise coming from behind a massive double door. [[Bill]] started taking position, blending with the walls to remain unseen for when the opportunity arose to throw his [[Black Star]] at the first enemy coming into sight.
[[Castle-8]] smashed open one of the doors, revealing a massive battle between infected [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]], [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] and [[Lizardfolk]] happening, now also including giant [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] and spiky raging forms. The bigger ones rushed towards the door, attempting to attack [[The Party]], but they were swiftly mowed down by throwing stars, [[Wall of Fire|Walls of Fire]], booming blades, hacking and slashing.
![[sessions/3-34/suicide-rat.webp]]  
[[Exilian]] even sent out one of his special tricks, and sent out a [[Mad Rat]] that ran off towards the [[Troglodytes]] and exploded in a giant [[Fireball]], thanking [[Exilian]] for his sweet release into death!

## I was just getting comfy in my panic-room
After all the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] were down, the normal/spellcasting [[Troglodyte]] Shaman led [[The Party]] towards a closed off room where they did their special club knock to open up the door.

A strange looking [[Troglodyte]] came out introducing herself as [[Skriss]] and welcoming [[The Party]], saying they had waited a long time for [[The Party]] to come, ever since their colleague [[Grazillax]] made a portal for them from the [[Underdark]]. They mentioned [[The Party]] consistency had changed and only few remained. She also made a hint that since [[Grazillax]] saw [[The Party]] make it through the portal, they were doing alright and updated [[Skriss]] on what happened.

[[Skriss]] asked what dangers they had faced on this [[Tebinor|Shard]], [[The Party]] replied with [[Demon|Demons]], [[Shadow|Shadows]] and [[Undead]]. [[Skriss]] explained the [[Demon|Demons]] and [[Undead]] came from different [[Demon Lords]], each in control of their own domain, and they did not work together and could be used to fight one another. The news about the [[Shadow|Shadows]] was more concerning, noting they found their way to this [[Tebinor|Shard]].

[[Skriss]] grabbed out this [[Professor Orb]] which instantly said "Oh here we go again". She mentioned this should be able to help [[The Party]] understand the [[Demon|Demons]] better as it contained almost all lore and knowledge that was to know about them. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], being the [[Demon]] hunter of [[The Party]], was pushed forward to take it and study it as much as possible.
