## Deliberations at the [[Black Barrel Inn|Inn]]

[[The Party]] gathered at [[Black Barrel Inn]], where their companion [[Nuk]] was indulging in an impressive feast. [[Castle-8]] was noticeably shiny as he sat at the bar, with his [[Undead]] dog [[Pikachu]] by his side, drawing a lot of attention to the both of them. As they enjoyed the atmosphere, the group discussed their next move. They were torn between returning to the undead [[Ice Cave]], where [[Horatio]]'s money lied, and venturing to the mysterious, and seemingly impossible, [[Shadow]]-Infested [[Gamwater Quarry|Quarry]]. During their deliberations, [[Layden Fantail|Layden]] turned the conversation toward another character, [[Exilian]], making some insulting remarks about his less-than-optimal appearance. Just then, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] arrived, encouraging the group to revisit [[Anorak Iron Mine]], where they previously encounter the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]]. He inquired about [[Undead]] [[Enphine]]'s condition, who confirmed that nothing had changed with her stability, and then shifted the focus to [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], who held a mysterious [[Professor Orb|Orb]] containing a [[Professor Orb|Professor]].
## Consulting the [[Professor Orb|Orb]] and [[Demon|Demonic]] Insights

[[The Party]] turned their attention to the [[Professor Orb|Orb]] carried by [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]], which housed a rather irritable [[Professor Orb|Professor]]. The [[Professor Orb|Professor]] expressed his frustration with the lack of progress in gathering information about the [[Demon Lord|Demon Lords]]. [[Horatio]] was fascinated by the orb's technology, much to the [[Professor Orb|Professor]]'s annoyance, who labeled him another simpleton. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] stepped in to explain [[Horatio]]'s (lack of) intellect, which earned him the [[Professor Orb|Professor]]’s respect. The conversation shifted as [[Exilian]] began asking detailed questions about the [[Demon Lord|Demon Lords]], specifically asking information about one whose influence tied to the [[Undead]] and [[Skeleton|Skeletons]], [[Orcus]]. [[The Party]] then asked about the [[Demon Lord]] who was troubling the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]], which the [[Professor Orb|Professor]] identified as  [[Demogorgon]]. The [[Professor Orb|Professor]] provided some insight into [[Demogorgon]], and they discuss whether his influence could be removed. Eventually [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] grew impatient with the lengthy discussions and headed outside, expecting the others to follow. As they prepare to leave, a guard nervously asked them to keep [[Castle-8]]’s new undead dog [[Pikachu]] out of the [[Ebonwatch|Town]], showing their unease with its presence. [[Horatio]] voiced his doubt on whether [[The Society]] could be trusted, but the rest of [[The Party]] wasn't really concerned. 
## The Maze and the Ambush

As [[The Party]] continued their journey, they arrived at the [[Anorak Iron Mine]] and were greeted by [[Ian]], who once again statically welcomed them on behalf of [[The Society]]. Without much hesitation, [[The Party]] headed down toward their [[Troglodyte]] ally, passing through several streams and going underwater until they reached [[Skriss]] and the [[Lizardfolk]] and [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] accompanying them. [[Skriss]] informed them that the direct route to the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] had been blocked by rockslides caused by the [[Mad Ones]]. Fortunately, the [[Lizardfolk]] and unpossessed [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] had cleared a new, though winding, path into the underwater tunnels.

[[The Party]] ventured into this maze-like detour when [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] noticed nets hidden in the ceiling and floor. Transforming into a [[Giant Constrictor Snake]], he attempted to bring down the nets, triggering an ambush. [[The Party]] found themselves chest-deep in water as possessed [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]] and a large [[Komodo Dragon]] emerged while the net snapped shut, trapping [[Enphine]] and [[Pikachu]]. The battle was fierce: [[Enphine]] was repeatedly knocked down and brought back up. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]’s thunder attacks caused shockwaves through the water, causing great pain to everyone, once again dropping [[Enphine]]. [[Castle-8]] dealt significant damage while enduring heavy hits, driven mad by the loss of his beloved [[Pikachu]]. [[Exilian]] attempted a stealthy attack, but was thwarted by a [[Troglodyte]]. [[Horatio]]’s most intelligent [[Thunderwave]] spell unfortunately downed some of their own party members. Amidst the chaos, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] and the [[Komodo Dragon]] engaged in a strange grappling match as [[The Party]] struggled to regain control of the fight.
## Narrow Escape and Last-Minute Rescues

In a heroic turn of events, [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] managed to save [[The Party]] by reviving [[Enphine]] with a health potion. [[Enphine]] then stabilized [[Castle-8]], who was then removed out of the fight by [[Horatio]] by a strategic [[Vortex Warp]]. With [[The Party]] regrouped, they begin a strategic retreat. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], having reverted from his wild shape, summoned a swarm of bees to cover their escape and keep the [[Komodo Dragon]] at bay. 

As [[The Party]] made their escape, [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] continued to drag [[Exilian]] to safety, ensuring his companion was out of harm's way. He was also able to grab a sword dropped by one of the [[Troglodyte|Troglodytes]]. Frustrated with the chaos, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], in his grumpy state, handed [[Horatio]] a bunch of health potions and urged him to fix the mess caused by his [[Thunderwave]] spell. With that, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] headed out of the tunnels. The rest of [[The Party]] regrouped and stabilized inside the tunnels.
