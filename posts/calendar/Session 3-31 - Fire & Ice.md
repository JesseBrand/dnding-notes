## Indecisiveness
As [[The Party]] met up with each other again at [[Black Barrel Inn]], they immediately erupted into discussing what grand quest they would take up this week. They consulted the message board and [[Chamberlain Gerrard]], who was apt to encourage them to help out with the open jobs. They discussed mapping the [[Tebinor|Shard]], going after the [[Fire Snakes]] again and visiting the [[Shadow|Shadows]] in the [[Royal Woodlands]]. They settled on investigating the [[Fire Snakes]] while mapping the [[Tebinor|Shard]], the latter of which was quickly forgotten.
## Time for a change of jobs
[[The Party]] moved back to [[Hornwood]] and further towards the the fiery forest they were before to further mapping the [[Tebinor|Shard]] and to check what had happened with the lumber supply at the same time. when they came to the woods they passed through the ashlands they cleared earlier, then noticed that the whole forest was on fire. A couple of fire serpents were slithering around within the flames. When they headed out the a serpent seemed to run straight into them and commenced the attack.

[[Bill]] started off by stabbing the first big fire serpent in the jaw, which first seemed to inflict a lot of damage but turned out to be mostly blocked by the armor after all. The serpent then started to focus on [[Bill]] and grappled him with its tail, the rest of [[The Party]] was caught by surprise by a bunch of smaller serpents. They seemed to like [[Enphine]] and her fire idol and started biting and whipping her. [[Castle-8]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] started to defend her whilst [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] moved in to protect [[Bill]], meanwhile [[Horatio]] decided to change career and gave tanking a try and sprinted forwards towards [[Bill]] to defend him.

The serpents seemed to ignore [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] in his snake form and went full scale on [[Horatio]] and [[Bill]], downing [[Bill]] and making [[Horatio]] rethink his life/career choices. He tried to push the giant fire serpents away with a wind wall but this just seemed to fuel the fire that was the hatred for [[Horatio]]. Meanwhile, [[Castle-8]] and [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] seemed to do a better job in defending and fended off the smaller serpents.

As fire spells didn't seem to have a lot of effect [[Enphine]] decided to drop her [[Crystal Teddy Bear Avatar]] and try to focus on icy spells. However due to her bond with the [[Crystal Teddy Bear Avatar|Teddy Bear]], she still seemed to be affected heavily by the damage of her own spells.

Meanwhile, [[Bill]] was downed by the giant fire serpents. The whole party went in for revenge, almost forgetting that [[Bill]] was bleeding out on the ground. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] swooped in and stabilized [[Bill]] in the name of [[Glub-Glub]], then [[Horatio]] cast [[Tasha's Caustic Brew|Some kind of acid spell]] on both giant fire Serpents dealing massive damage. Shortly after all fire serpents were killed and went up in flames as their armors and spears were looted. [[The Party]] recovered to move on and tried to find out what was happening to the forest.
## Sundae anyone?
[[The Party]] analyzed how all Fire Serpents seemed to flee from the north, and thus they headed in that direction, finding a [[Giant Crater Covered in Ice]]. While [[Enphine]] wanted to know where she was heading before heading down the rest of [[The Party]] just boldly moved forward. [[Bill]] just climbed down but fell flat on his face to the ground. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], still being a giant constructor snake moved his body down the ridge to help [[Bill]] up and created a slide. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] went down first successfully without too much trouble sliding onto the ice, followed by [[Castle-8]] who had the same trajectory as [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]]. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] avoided a collision by jumping to the side. [[Horatio]] went on next which went splendid, but near the end [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] gave his tail a whack to throw [[Horatio]] off balance. [[Horatio]] was nimble enough to recover from this.
[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] moved on leaving [[Enphine]] on top of the ridge to finish her ritual, [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] slid towards a huge rock on the ice which twisted and turned up straight into a [[Giant Goblin Demon]] with room for a baby in its ribcage.
## Is that a dead baby in your ribcage or are you just happy to see [[Bill]]?
[[Bill]] charged in head-first and started throwing his [[Black Star]] at the deformed creature in the creature's ribcage, dealing a nice amount of damage but also pissing it off and focusing its attention on [[Bill]]. The creature created a vortex of necrotic energy around it, inflicting great damage on the party, which was something [[Bill]] couldn't handle, instantly downing him, making him a very attractive adoption orphan to fill the hole in its chest. [[Enphine]] finally stopped the ritual as she saw the chaos that unfolded below. She set up a [[Wall of Fire]] trying to block the creature from grabbing [[Bill]]. [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] perfectly comboed this with booming blade, eventually downing the creature with the help of [[Castle-8]]'s smite.

Before it went down, a second creature emerged from a rock a little further up ahead, intent on adopting the body that was formerly [[Bill]] and that was now lying helplessly on the ground.  It was halted in its tracks by [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]]'s grapple, however it did its nasty skill thing again, in addition to using its huge claws, turning [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] back to normal. [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]], now only holding the creature's toenail, was unable to keep him in place, which allowed him to move away freely. But before the creature could reach [[Bill]], [[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] cast Healing Word on [[Bill]] to get him back up his feet. Shortly after, [[Enphine]] put down another [[Wall of Fire]]. With [[Castle-8]] hitting it heavily, [[The Party]] was successful in downing the undead [[Demon]] thingies.

[[Sir Dixon Fire|Sir Dixon]] acted like usual by removing the loincloths from the now-disintegrating bodies, which [[Enphine]] then identified. She mentioned it was wise not to give these to the people of [[Ebonwatch]] as they were cursed with an undead energy. [[Enphine]] went on further to study the ice as this seemed to be some kind of magical ice, apparently scaring away the surrounding nature.
