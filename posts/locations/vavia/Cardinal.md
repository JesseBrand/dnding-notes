A Cardinal is the highest achievable rank within the [[Vavian Church]], other than His Holyness the [[Emperor]] himself. Only the [[Emperor]] has the power to to appoint a Cardinal, who may then be appointed to one of the Shards.

A Cardinal serves as the representative of the [[Emperor]] on a shard and owes allegiance to no-one but the [[Emperor]] himself.

Not every shard has an assigned Cardinal. Frontier Shards tend to not have a Cardinal until the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]]'s presence has been well-established. Shard with little [[Vaviel Empire|Imperial]] presence, such as the desolate Shard of [[Asholas]] does not have a Cardinal assigned.
