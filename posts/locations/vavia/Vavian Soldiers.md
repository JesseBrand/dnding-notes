The regular Soldiers employed by the [[Vaviel Empire]] can be found on any of the [[Shards]] under control of the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]], and the ones under contention.

The Vavian Soldiers are usually well-trained and well-equipped, each man being outfitted with at least a breastplate, open helmet and a pike. Higher-ranking Soldiers and members of the [[Vavian Noble|Nobility]] are usually equipped a lot better. Where possible and needed, the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] will attempt to outfit key Units and [[Vavian Noble|Nobles]] with [[Magic Items]] or employ members of [[The Tempest]] along the Army.

The army is under command of the [[Vavian Noble|Vavian Nobility]], with [[Vavian Noble#Dukes|Dukes]], [[Vavian Noble#Counts|Counts]] and [[Vavian Noble#Barons|Barons]] often commanding armies as a whole.

## Types of Soldiers
### Guardsmen
Simple Guardsmen can be found guarding every town, fortress and city in the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]], as well as many villages. Their presence is more notable on [[Shards#Others|Contested Shards]]. These are usually the least well-trained soldiers, not expecting a lot of resistance.

### Conscripts
Conscripts make up the bulk of the Vavian Army. Better equipped than Guardsmen and usually under the command of a [[Vavian Noble|Noble]], they are sent where the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] needs them. These fight the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]]'s wars and can be found on the front lines. They are well-trained and know how to fight as part of a group.

### Scouts
Scouts form special units, often accompanying the armies of the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]]. They are trained in stealth and reconnaissance. The [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] relies on them to gather information on enemy positions, movements and numbers. For these purposes, they are sometimes entrusted with [[Magic Items]] to make their jobs easier.

### Nobles
[[Vavian Noble|Knights]] and other [[Vavian Noble|Nobles]] are frequently found leading units or fighting in the front lines where their advanced training and equipment is needed most. Small detachments of [[Vavian Noble#Knights|Knights]] are also sent on Expeditions in order to reach a specific goal, usually related to war objectives.

### Martial Orders
The [[Emperor]] employs the Elite Orders of [[Chevalier|Chevaliers]] and [[Custodians]] as his own private Elite army. They are only sent into battle at the behest of the [[Emperor]] himself. If these orders are encountered on a battlefield, the [[Emperor]] has taken a personal interest in the happenings. Few stand in their way.
