A [[Portal]] connecting two [[Shards]].

One end is located on the shard of [[Tuletus]].
The other end is located in the fortress of [[Wheldrake Fortress]] on the shard of [[Tebinor]].

Both sides are under control of the [[Vaviel Empire]].

The portal is currently closed. Nobody on the shard of [[Tebinor]] seems to know why.
