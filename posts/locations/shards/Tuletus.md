The [[Shards|shard]] of Tuletus is a major shard within the [[Vaviel Empire]]. The Empire has uncontested dominion over the shard.

Tuletus is being actively developed but still contains vast stretches of grassland, woodland and mountain ranges, with several large cities making up the bulk of the centralized power of the Empire's presence.

[[The Tempest]] have a clear presence on the shard, having a chapter in every major city.
