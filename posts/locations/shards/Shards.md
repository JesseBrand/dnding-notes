aliases: Shard, Domain of Shards

The aptly named Domain of Shards consists of many Shards, both known and unknown to the [[Race|Races]] inhabiting them.

[[The Party]] hass currently settled on the Shard of [[Tebinor]], taking refuge within the town of [[Ebonwatch]] belonging to the [[Vaviel Empire]]. The [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] has dominion over many Shards but knows very well that more Shards are outside of their control, having fought many wars and battles over the centuries. 

The Shards themselves are huge rocks floating in space that are somehow capable of maintaining an atmosphere. They have clear boundaries where they simply end into nothingness.

There are many theories on how the Shards came to be. A popular [[Creation Myths of the Shards|Myth]] involves an [[Ancients|Advanced Race]] causing the destruction of a world and the Shards being the remnants of this.

[[The Tempest]] is always trying to find strands to other Shards: Magical, dormant connections that once linked the world together. When a strand is uncovered, a connection to another shard is established and a [[Portal]] is opened. The connection is usually established as a one-way [[Portal]] at first, to prevent whatever may already be present in the Shard from spilling out into the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]]. Under the leadership of [[His Holiness Titerus Artenix VII]] and his forebears, the [[Vaviel Empire]] has conquered 16 shards, with Tebinor on its way to become the 17th.

Now that [[The Party]] has informed the [[Vaviel Empire|Empire]] of the existence of the Shard of [[Phandalin|"Phalladin"]], this has certainly drawn the attention of [[The Tempest]].
