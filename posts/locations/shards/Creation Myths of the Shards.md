Legends on how the [[Shards]] came to be are widespread. Supposedly, an [[Ancients|Advanced Race]] once lived here, in harmony with the younger races. We know them only as the [[Ancients]]. At some point they were all destroyed and their world with them. Some say they were at war with each other or got attacked by a force not from their world, some say they caused the destruction themselves. No-one knows for sure.

This supposed event is referred to as the [[Cataclysm]] and ruptured the world apart into what we know as the [[Shards]]. Different [[Race|Races]] and creatures were scattered among the shards and life developed separately on each. The [[Shards]] each developed on their own, but are not entirely disconnected.
