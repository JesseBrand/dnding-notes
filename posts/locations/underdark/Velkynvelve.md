Velkynvelve was a [[Drow]] Prison located far to the southeast of the [[Darklake]] in the [[Underdark]]. It was quite well-defended, by virtue of it being located at the top of a very large cavern, with only a single elevator to move guards and prisoners between the outpost and the cavern floor. It was under control of [[House Myzzrym]], with [[Ilvara Myzzrym]] herself regularly attending the prison and sending prisoners there to be interrogated or forgotten.

## Layout
The main quarters Velkynvelve were built in the hollowed-out husks of four enormous stalactites hanging from the ceiling of the cavern. Five large natural alcoves in the side of the cave created a few additional rooms, which were sealed with heavy doors. These areas were connected with wood-and-rope bridges. A plateau jutted out of the side of the cave, connecting the two smallest stalactites, were guard quarters were established. The elevator down was also located at this plateau, guarded at all times.

A large waterfall emerged from the side of the cavern high up, crashing down besides the rope bridges and crashing into a lake on the cavern floor 150ft below. At the lower end of the stalactites, somewhat below the outpost, [[Giant Spider|Giant Spiders]] had created a large web structure, catching anything and anyone that would fall or be thrown down from the outpost.

### Prison
A prison was established in the largest of the five alcoves, with a heavy door closing off the only way out. The prisoners were usually employed on heavy labor duty outside the prison in shifts. Some would be sent to the kitchen for cooking, some would be sent for cleaning duties. Every once in a while, a prison would be thrown down to the spiders, to set an example.

### Guards
The outpost was manned by several [[Drow]] Elite Warriors and a squad of lesser [[Drow]] Warriors. A trusted [[Priestess of Lolth]] was usually in attendance.

In addition, a group of [[Quaggoth]] were stationed at the prison as brute muscle. While dumb, they could be relied upon to provide heavy resistance to any attempt of breakout.

## Involvement
When [[The Party]] was able to locate the [[Forge of Spells]] in [[Wave Echo Cave]], a [[Drow Hunting Party]] under the command of [[Asha Vandree]] apprehended them and led them to [[Velkynvelve]] as captives. After a long and tenuous journey, the party was locked up and put to work. They met several other captives here, along which [[Buttercup]] and [[Exilian]], who they recruited into [[The Party]].

[[The Party]] planned their escape carefully, but the plan unfolded quite differently than expected. While [[The Breakout of Velkynvelve]] was successful, plenty of casualties were unfortunately had.
