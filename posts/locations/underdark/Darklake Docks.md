The Darklake Docks is the northernmost [[Gracklstugh#Districts|District]] of [[Gracklstugh]] and the least secure. It borders the [[Darklake]] on one side and the [[Gracklstugh#Fortifications|Gracklstugh Walls]] on the other three. It is the only place in [[Gracklstugh]] where [[Race|Races]] other than [[Duergar]] and [[Derro]] are at least somewhat tolerated.

Notable Landmarks in the Darklake Docks:
* The Docks, where shipping and trade enters and leaves [[Gracklstugh]].
* [[The Shattered Spire]], the tavern constructed on a stalagmite in the [[Darklake]] a short distance from the coast.
