Gracklstugh was mostly destroyed during the [[Blaze of Gracklstugh]], where [[Themberchaud]] burned down most of the city after he discovered the betrayal by the [[Keepers of the Flame]].

Gracklstugh was continuously filled with a thick [[Grackl-Lung|Smog]], making breathing hard. Since the city was located underground, the fouled air was not able to escape. The [[Duergar]] and [[Derro]] native to the City learned to deal with it naturally, but many visitors developed [[Grackl-Lung]].
