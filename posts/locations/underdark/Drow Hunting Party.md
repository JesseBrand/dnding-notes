[[Ilvara Myzzrym]]'s hunting party was established after [[The Party]] escaped from [[Velkynvelve]]. Its sole purpose was to hunt down [[The Party]].

They chased [[The Party]] through the [[Silken Paths]] all the way to [[Sloobludop]], but lost track of them after they took boats onto the [[Darklake]] after the town was destroyed by [[Demogorgon]].

The party consisted of:
* [[Ilvara Myzzrym]]
* [[Asha Vandree]]
* [[Shoor Vandree]]
* [[Jorlan Duskryn]]
* Several Elite [[Drow]] Warriors and regular warriors.
