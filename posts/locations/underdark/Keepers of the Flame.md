aliases: Keepers

The Keepers of the Flame were a religious organisation of [[Duergar]] in the city of [[Gracklstugh]] in the [[Underdark]].

They held quite some sway over the city and over [[Deepking Horgar Steelshadow V]] because they commanded and appeased [[Themberchaud]], the Red [[Dragon]] overseer of [[Gracklstugh]] who kept the forges ablaze.

Secretly, the Keepers forged a plan to replace [[Themberchaud]] with a younger dragon that would be more easy to control, something they apparently did more often in the past.

When the Red [[Dragon]] egg to accomplish this plan was stolen, the Keepers recruited [[The Party]] to recover it from the [[Whorlstone Tunnels]]. When they returned with a hatched [[Dragon]] Wyrmling they had named [[Firestarter]], the Keepers revealed their plan to [[The Party]] and begged them not to tell [[Themberchaud]]. When [[The Party]] and especially [[Drathuul]] refused, it led to a confrontation between the Keepers and [[The Party]], where several members of the Keepers were killed. When [[Themberchaud]] was told of this betrayal, he turned against the Keepers as well as the city of [[Gracklstugh]], which led to the [[Blaze of Gracklstugh]].
