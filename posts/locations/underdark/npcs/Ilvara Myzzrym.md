Ilvara Myzzrym was the [[Drow]] [[Matriarch]] of [[House Myzzrym]]. She was a cruel and ambitious [[Drow]].

Under her leadership, [[The Party]] was captured in [[Wave Echo Cave]] after discovering the [[Forge of Spells]] and taken to the [[Drow]] Stronghold of [[Velkynvelve]].

After [[The Party]] escaped [[Velkynvelve]], Ilvara chased them down relentlessly, forming a [[Drow Hunting Party|Hunting Party]] with the sole purpose of hunting them down.

She has spies all over the [[Underdark]], including presumably within the city of [[Gracklstugh]].
