Errde Blackskull was a [[Duergar]] and commanded the [[Stone Guard]] in [[Grackstugh]]. She reported directly to [[Deepking Horgar Steelshadow V]].

Seeing the unrest caused by increasing [[Madness]] in the city, she employed the party to find the source of the [[Madness]] and find the [[Derro]] [[Droki]] in the [[Whorlstone Tunnels]], who apparently had a major role in what was going on.
