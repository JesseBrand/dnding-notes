The Darklake is a huge underground collection of lakes, rivers, rapids and underwater basins stretching many hundreds of miles through the [[Underdark]]. It is possible to traverse large parts of the Darklake by boat, but doing so is not without risk. Many creatures make their lairs in the deep waters, and more creatures live in the open caves above it, preying on those who would come to close.

Several sets of Locks have been built on the Darklake, to allow boats to travel to areas where the water levels are significantly higher or lower.

Ever since more and more [[Demon|Demons]] have been sighted in the [[Underdark]], travelling has become all the more dangerous.

However, water means trade. Therefore, several towns and cities have been built along the Darklake over the centuries. Some notable places of interest are:
* The [[Kuo-Toa]] village of [[Sloobludop]], which was destroyed when [[Demogorgon]] emerged from the Darklake was located on its southeastern shores.
* The [[Duergar]] city of [[Gracklstugh]], which was left in ruin after the [[Blaze of Gracklstugh]] is located on its western shores.
* The [[Deep Gnome|Svirfneblin]] city of [[Blingdenstone]] is located on its northwestern shores.
* The [[Drow]] city of [[Menzobaranzan]] was located not far north of the Darklake, but did not border it directly.
