The [[Silverlight]] Family built a Cabin in the [[Neverwinter Woods]] after they were exiled from the town of [[Triboar]] after [[Pandora Silverlight|Pandora]] refused to abandon her [[Orc|Half-Orc]] son [[Alaric]].

[[Aiken Silverlight|Aiken]], [[Pandora Silverlight|Pandora]] and [[Alaric]] lived in the Cabin in relative peace before a [[Bear#Black Bear|Black Bear]] came upon the Cabin and killed [[Aiken Silverlight|Aiken]] and [[Pandora Silverlight|Pandora]]. While Alaric was grieving, [[Goblin|Goblins]] raided the Cabin, sending [[Alaric]] upon a quest that would have him join [[The Blue Crusaders]] and go on to [[Search for the Forge of Spells|Find the Forge of Spells]].
