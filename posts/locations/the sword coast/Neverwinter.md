The City of Neverwinter is one of the larger Cities on the [[Sword Coast]]. It is located on the coast and along the [[High Road]], ensuring a lot of trade finds its way to the City.

The City sustained heavy damage when [[Mount Hotenow]] erupted some years ago, but has been rebuilt since and is quite prosperous.

The [[Search for the Forge of Spells]] began when [[Gundren Rockseeker]] recruited [[The Party]] in [[The Laughing Bean]] in Neverwinter.
