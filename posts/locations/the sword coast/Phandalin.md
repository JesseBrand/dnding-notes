Phandalin is a little mining village located on the edge of the [[Neverwinter Woods]] along the [[Triboar Trail]] running from the [[High Road]] near the coast to the town of [[Triboar]] to the east.

Phandalin was built atop the ruins of some older town, larger and laid to waste centuries before the village was founded. Many old ruins could therefore be found outside the village, a testament to times long past.

The village was located near the [[Sword Mountains]] and many lucrative ore veins therein. The mountains were mined for Gold, Platinum and [[Cold Iron]], many of its business centered around the [[Phandalin Miner's Exchange|Miner's Exchange]].

Phandalin was the centerpoint of the [[Search for the Forge of Spells]], when [[Gundren Rockseeker]] had[[The Blue Crusaders]] locate and find himself and the [[Forge of Spells]] in [[Wave Echo Cave]].
