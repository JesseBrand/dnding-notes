The Triboar Trail is a minor thoroughfare in the [[Sword Coast]] and runs west to east, connecting the [[High Road]] near the coast between [[Neverwinter]] and [[Leilon]] to the town of [[Triboar]]. It passes by the village of [[Phandalin]] and the abandoned village of [[Conyberry]] and leads between the south edge of the [[Neverwinter Woods]] and the north edge of the [[Sword Mountains]].
