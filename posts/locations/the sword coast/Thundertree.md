Thundertree was a small village on the edge of the [[Neverwinter Woods]].

[[The Party]], then known as [[The Blue Crusaders]] ventured to Thundertree to locate the [[Druid]] [[Reidoth]], who supposedly knew the way to [[Cragmaw Castle]].

Upon exploring the village, [[The Party]] fought many [[Twig Blight|Twig Blights]] and several [[Ash Zombie|Ash Zombies]] before meeting with [[Reidoth]]. While he did not appreciate the party much, he did value the presence of [[John]] and [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and offered them shelter. He told the party of a Green [[Dragon]] making its home in the tower of the village. After debating among themselves, the party decided to take on the [[Dragon]].

The next [[The Party]] faced the Green [[Dragon]], who was named [[Venomfang]]. While successful in slaying the beast, [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] was killed by its acidic breath. As the party took him back to [[Reidoth]], [[Teezee]], who was convinced he could fly using the power of the [[Dragon]], leapt down from the tower and barely made it alive.

[[Reidoth]] was distraught when he found out [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] died and offered to let nature [[Reincarnation|Reincarnate]] him. As he did, a new body formed for [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] and when he woke up, he had the shock of his life as he was no longer a [[Halfling]] but an [[Aarakocra]].

[[The Party]] further explored the village and faced more [[Twig Blight|Twig Blights]] and [[Ash Zombie|Ash Zombies]] as well as [[Dragon Cultists]]. The full extend of [[Teezee]]'s [[Wild Magic]] became visible as he exploded where he stood along with the party, rapidly drained the party of life, summoned a Celestial [[Unicorn]] and got it to attack the party. [[Alaric]] got quite mad at [[Teezee]], but decided not to kill him in the end.

The party left Thundertree to find [[Cragmaw Castle]] and continue the [[Search for the Forge of Spells]].
