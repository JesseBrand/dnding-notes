The Neverwinter Woods are a large woodland and located to the east of the City of [[Neverwinter]]. They stretch from [[Mount Hotenow]] in the north to the [[Triboar Trail]] and [[Sword Mountains]] in the south.

The Neverwinter woods are home to many locations, some known and some hidden. Because of the density of the woods, it is a frequent hiding place from anyone dodging the law, as well as tribes of [[Goblin|Goblins]], [[Orc|Orcs]] and [[Ogre|Ogres]].

Notable Locations in the Neverwinter Woods:
- The Village of [[Thundertree]] is located on the western edge of the Woods.
- [[Cragmaw Castle]] lies in a hidden location in the south part of the Woods.
- The Village of [[Conyberry]] is located at the southeastern edge of the Woods.
- The Village of [[Phandalin]] lies on the other side of the [[Triboar Trail]] to the South of the Woods.
