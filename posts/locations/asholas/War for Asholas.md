The war for Ashalos started when the [[Army of Demons and Orcs]] invaded the shard of [[Tuletus]] and lay waste to the [[Hollow Range Woods]].

The [[Vaviel Empire]] was reinforced from [[Vavia]] and waged a war on the shard, eventually finding the main portal to the undiscovered, desolate shard of [[Asholas]] and taking the fight there.
