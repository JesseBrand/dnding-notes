Florentin Carrell is a [[Human]] Merchant and member of the [[Merchant Guild]] of the [[Vaviel Empire]].

He has come to [[Tebinor]] to provide a General Store to the [[Vaviel Empire]] in the newly founded town of [[Ebonwatch]]. He named it [[The Dark Road Goods 'n Ammo]]

Now that the [[Portal between Tebinor and Tuletus]] is closed, Florentin is looking for other sources of resources that are desperately needed in the town.

#TODO: where from? why come here?
