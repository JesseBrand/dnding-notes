There is a [[Troglodyte]] Lair located underneath [[Anorak Iron Mine]] in the [[Slumbering Hills]]. [[The Party]] discovered the Lair as they made their way through the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Mine]] in [[Session 3-14 - The Trapped Lair|Sepdas 1 514]].

### First Level
Its top level is a very moisty tiled temple structure with a spiral staircase in the middle of a large room, connecting it to the [[Anorak Iron Mine|Mine]] above. Four smaller rooms are located off the main room. A sixth room is located to the south, where a stairway leading down was found. The level below seems to be flooded however, and [[The Party]] is trying to figure out a way to explore it.
