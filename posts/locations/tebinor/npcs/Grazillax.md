Grazillax was a [[Mindflayer]] and member of the [[Society of Brilliance]].

He met [[The Party]] in the [[Underdark]] after the [[Blaze of Gracklstugh]] and warned them of a nearby [[Gnoll]] horde.

With the help of [[The Party]], he was able to open a [[Portal between Tebinor and the Underdark|portal]] out of the [[Underdark]], leading to the shard of [[Tebinor]]. While [[The Party]] was able to escape through the portal, Grazillax did not follow.
