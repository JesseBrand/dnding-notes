A [[Goblin]] Warren serves as the village for a [[Goblin Tribe]] of [[Goblin|Goblins]]. It is usually quite chaotic, messy, and very smelly. [[Goblin|Goblins]] usually use an existing location, such as an old ruin or cave for their Warren.

Goblin Warrens of interest in the Campaign:
- The Cave identified as the [[Cragmaw Hideout]] near the [[Triboar Trail]] was used as a Warren by the [[Cragmaw Tribe]].
- [[Cragmaw Castle]] in the [[Neverwinter Woods]] was used as a Warren by the [[Cragmaw Tribe]].
