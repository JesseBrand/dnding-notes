A Meteorite was located within the [[Gleaming Mire]]. After learning of it from [[Granny Moss]], [[The Party]] set out to locate it.

After fending off the dangers of the swamp in the form of [[Bullywug|Bullywugs]] and a [[Giant Crocodile]], they were able to find the Meteorite, which was actually a boat-shaped metal object.

After prying loose some of the scrap metal and bringing it back to [[Ebonwatch]], they found out the metal was actually the highly valuable [[Starmetal]], which was invaluable for the forging of strong weapons.

[[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Castle-8]] and [[Alaric]] made several trips to the Meteorite to return as much [[Starmetal]] as possible and struck a deal with [[Duke Oakfire]], turning a hefty profit and investing in the compound of [[Gryffindork]].

After the news spread, many inhabitants of [[Ebonwatch]] also tried their luck by braving the dangers of the Mire to strike it rich. Few actually found the site and returned with [[Starmetal]]. Few others never made it back.
