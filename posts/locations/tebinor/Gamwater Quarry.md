Gamwater Quarry is a stone Quarry located in the [[Gamwater Hills]] to the east of [[Ebonwatch]] on the shard of [[Tebinor]].

After hearing stories of dangerous creatures dwelling within the quarry, the local populace stayed away from the quarry. When [[The Party]] visited the quarry they were greeted by a lady named [[Essephy]], who warned them to stay away and tried to gauge their intentions. When they proceeded into the quarry they encountered a sapphire [[Dragon]] named [[Nivrath]], along with [[Essephy]], who turned out to be an Emerald [[Dragon]]. After a short battle to prove their strength, where [[Castle-8]] dealt a few tremendous blows, the [[Dragon|Dragons]] asked the adventurers to fight a great evil down in their lair. When the party agreed, [[Nivrath]] parted the stone and let them in.

[[The Party]] made their way through old tunnels and encountered a few dark, starry [[Shadow Rift|Rifts]]. When they ran into a sphere of darkness they were engaged by a [[Shadow Beholder]], who they were barely able to beat. [[Drathuul]] sadly lost his life their. When [[The Party]] returned his body to the [[Dragon|Dragons]], they offered to lay him to rest, which [[The Party]] agreed to.

A deal was struck between [[The Party]], the [[Dragon|Dragons]] and [[Duke Oakfire]] of [[Ebonwatch]], ensuring the safe mining of stone from the quarry while [[The Party]] would ensure the safety of the laborers.

After a conflict with [[Sir Dozak the Magnificent]], [[Bavon]] was sent to perform forced labor in the quarry for an undetermined period of time.

Recently, [[Shadow|Shadows]] have been spotted around the quarry, including a  Huge Shadow that [[Paxton Umbra|Paxton]] spotted during the night. The [[Dragon|Dragons]] are clearly afraid of the [[Shadow|Shadows]], but have told the party that these would become vulnerable in daylight. [[The Party]] ponders their next move.
