A Town located on a dark rocky hill in the middle of the [[Oakfire Plains]] on [[Tebinor]], Ebonwatch is the center of [[Vaviel Empire|Imperial Power]] on the shard of [[Ebonwatch]]. It is ruled by [[Duke Oakfire]].

The location of Ebonwatch was chosen because of its defensive area, located upon a large, overgrown jet-black rock plateau. The ground is fertile but the plateau would be somewhat hard to take in an assault.

[[Ebonwatch Keep]] was established with a small village next to it, that grew out into a small Town when more immigrants followed. A Palisade fortified with Guardtowers was erected around the town, but several camps have since been established outside of the Palisade. The construction of the Palisade and town was somewhat delayed when the [[Hornwood]] Lumbermill ceased Lumber deliveries for a while when woodcutters were lost in the woods.

Ebonwatch houses a population of about 350 people, including the [[Vavian Soldiers|Soldiers]] stationed in [[Ebonwatch Keep]] and the surrounding areas. Many of these are employed in different dependencies in the surrounding areas.
