aliases: Mire, Swamp

A large swampland bordering the [[Oakfire Plains]] to the southeast of [[Ebonwatch]] on the shard of [[Tebinor]].

[[Granny Moss]], a friendly and respected elder of [[Ebonwatch]] lives in a [[Granny Moss' Hut|Hut]] on the edge of the swamp.

It is home to many dangers, such as [[Giant Crocodile|Giant Crocodiles]], [[Bullywug|Bullywugs]] and [[Will-o'-Wisp|Will-o'Wisps]].

In [[Session 3-6 - Mysteries of the Mire|Fifdas 1]], [[The Party]] went into the Mire to recover an item of great importance for [[Granny Moss]].

During the next few weeks, several members of [[The Party]] regularly went into the Mire to bring more [[Starmetal]] back from the [[Meteorite]]. After learning of the cache, many inhabitants of [[Ebonwatch]] also tried their luck by braving the dangers of the Mire to strike it rich. Few actually found the site and returned with [[Starmetal]]. Few others never made it back.
