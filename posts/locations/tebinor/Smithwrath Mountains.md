The Smithwrath Mountains are a large coastal mountain range located on the Shard of [[Tebinor]]. It is a hard place to travel to and only those with a specific destination in mind attempt to traverse these mountains.

[[Sootwall Observatory]] is located on one of its steepest slopes.

The mountains are subject to a [[Manticore]] infestation, threatening the area. Several [[Manticore Nests]] have been sighted alongside its cliff faces.
