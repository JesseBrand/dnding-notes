Ebonwatch Church is no more than a small chapel on a larger plot of lands outside the walls of [[Ebonwatch]].

It was set up by [[Girard de Kosigan]] using a starter fund granted to him by the [[Bishop of Addiarus]].

It consists of a wooden chapel and a small room for the acting [[Cleric|Priest]], currently [[Girard de Kosigan]], to sleep in.
