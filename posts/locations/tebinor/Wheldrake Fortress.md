Wheldrake Fortress is located north of the town of [[Ebonwatch]] on the shard of [[Tebinor]].

It was erected by the [[Vaviel Empire]] to safeguard the [[Portal between Tebinor and Tuletus|Portal]] back to [[Tuletus]].

The fortress is under control of the [[Vaviel Empire]] and under the jurisdiction of [[Duke Oakfire]].

Though the portal is currently inactive, the portal is still being guarded by guards under [[Duke Oakfire]].
