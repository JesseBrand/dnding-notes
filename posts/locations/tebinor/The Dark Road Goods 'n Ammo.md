The Dark Road is the general goods store in the town of [[Ebonwatch]] and thereby the general source of supplies for the [[Vaviel Empire]] on the Shard of [[Tebinor]].

[[Florentin Carrell]] is the Merchant in charge of The Dark Road and pays takes to [[Duke Oakfire]].

The Dark Road is supplied from the Shard of [[Tuletus]]. Now that the [[Portal between Tebinor and Tuletus]] is closed, townspeople are looking for other sources of supplies.
