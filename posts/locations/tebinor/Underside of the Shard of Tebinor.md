Being a [[Shards|Shard]], [[Tebinor]] is a large disc of rock that is inhabited on one side. The [[Gnome|Gnomes]] of [[Sootwall Observatory|Sootwall]] have long studied the [[Shards]] and employed a [[Telescope]] to observe these [[Shards]] from several directions. By utilizing complex calculations and reflective surfaces on space rocks around the [[Shards|Shard]], they were able to pinpoint a few key moments in time in which the celestial bodies were aligned and the [[Telescope]] was able to look directly onto the bottom of the [[Shards|Shard]] of [[Tebinor]].

... or so some highly intelligent [[Gnome]] [[Sootwall Observatory#Observers|Observers]] claim.

However, as they pointed the [[Telescope]] there and looked through it, things went sideways quickly. [[1st Observer Orxim Pebblebeard]] was the first to look through and whatever he saw turned him completely crazy. [[Nuk]], not able to control his curiosity, decided to look next, sharing a similar fate.

The knowledgeable [[Enphine]] however, prepared well and with the help of [[Horatio]] looked through in [[Session 3-14 - The Trapped Lair|Sepdas 1 514]]. She was able to shield her mind from an invasive presence and looked right at the underside of the [[Shards|Shard]]. What she saw was of great concern.

### The Underside
As [[Enphine]] watched, the underside of the [[Shards|Shard]] was covered in [[Darkness]]. It seemed to be covered by some sort of purple energy field, but her mind was able to penetrate that. Beneath that she saw a large swath of black land, only it was moving ever so slightly. It was as if the entire plain was alive. Zooming further in with the help of [[Horatio]], she discovered that what she thought was a large plain was actually made up by countless dark creatures of varying sizes. They seemed to be set on a single purpose: digging down, assumingly to reach the surface.

As [[Enphine]] witnessed the events, she felt her mind drawn deeper into the horde of creatures. Shielding her mind with great effort, she was able to look away and return her mind to the [[Sootwall Observatory|Observatory]], noticing many [[Gnome|Gnomes]] holding their breath around her.

She later told what she saw to [[The Party]] in [[Black Barrel Inn]].
