aliases: Sootwall, Observatory
---
A [[Gnome|Gnomish]] enclave on the Shard of [[Tebinor]], the Observatory is run entirely by [[Gnome|Gnomes]]. They have a good understanding with the [[Vaviel Empire]] in [[Ebonwatch]] and operate pretty much independently.

The observatory houses among other things:
* A Giant Maze to ward off possible intruders,
* Vast Libraries of Spells and Historical Documents,
* A gigantic [[Telescope]] used to observe the [[Shards]].

Sootwall Observatory was attacked by [[Manticores]] in [[Session 3-9 - Fifdas 4 514|Fifdas 4]], but they were driven out by [[The Party]], which the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] were very thankful for. The top floor was heavily damaged in the attack and the [[Telescope]] needed repairs.

After repairing the telescope, the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] used a complex method of mirroring surfaces on nearby [[Shards]] to look at the underside of the Shard of [[Tebinor]]. However, as [[1st Observer Orxim Pebblebeard|Master Pebblebeard]] did so, he went crazy. None of the [[Gnome|Gnomes]] have dared repeat his observations since.

### Inhabitants
