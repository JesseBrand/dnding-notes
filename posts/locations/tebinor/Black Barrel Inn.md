Owned by [[Florellius Patar]]

Black Barrel Inn is the sole Inn of [[Ebonwatch]] and the [[Vaviel Empire]] on the shard of [[Tebinor]] and is therefore well-visited.

The Inn is ran by [[Florellius Patar]], a friendly old [[Human]] who has set up the Inn at the right place at the right time. Most of his [[Ale|Ales]] and food are imported, but his sons [[Julian Patar|Julian]] and [[Henry Patar|Henry]] run the nearby [[Black Barrel Brewery]] that supplies the local [[Ale|Ales]] Oakfire Brown and Black Barrel Brew.

The [[Notice Board]] informing any visitors to available jobs is located here, along with [[Chamberlain Gerrard]] who answers the questions of any parties interested in taking on jobs.
