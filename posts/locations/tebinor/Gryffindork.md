A compound within the walls of [[Ebonwatch]] owned by [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Alaric]] and [[Castle-8]].

It is still under construction, but when done will include a 2-story wooden house, a 2-story stone building containing a forge and a brewery, a 2-story wooden storage building and a walled garden in which they plan to grow brewing ingredients.

[[Duke Oakfire]] sold the land the compound is constructed on to [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] after the three returned a load of [[Starmetal]] to [[Ebonwatch]] and earning a lot of gold as a result.
