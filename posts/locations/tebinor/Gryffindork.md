A compound within the walls of [[Ebonwatch]] owned by [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]], [[Alaric]] and [[Castle-8]].

It is still under construction, but when done will include a 2-story wooden house, a 2-story stone building containing a forge and a brewery, a 2-story wooden storage building and a walled garden in which they plan to grow brewing ingredients.

[[Duke Oakfire]] sold the land the compound is constructed on to [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] after the three returned a load of [[Starmetal]] to [[Ebonwatch]] and earning a lot of gold as a result.

## Compound
The compound consists of two buildings. A two-story stone building contains a [[Smithing|Forge]] on the ground floor and a [[Brewer's Supplies|Brewery]] on the second floor.  A two-story wooden building serves as living and sleeping quarters. In between a smaller storehouse provides room for Barrels of [[Ale]] and other supplies to be stored.

### Main Building
The main building consists of two floors.

The [[Carpet from the Elven Ruin]] has a prominent place on the bottom floor. A large table with many chairs provides room for people to relax and a bar on the side can provide visitors with much-needed refreshments, including home-brewn [[Ale]].

### Forge & Brewery
The two-story stone building is still under construction.

When completed, the bottom floor will house the [[Smithing|Forge]] where multiple smiths can practice their crafts. The second floor will contains a [[Brewer's Supplies|Brewery]] with multiple stills. It will be connected to the storehouse in between the buildings, where the barrels of ale can be stored.

### Fields
There is room outside for some small fields to cultivate grain and hops on. Although the ground within [[Ebonwatch]] itself is not very fertile, [[Sam Alderleaf|Sam]] intend to have [[Nuk]] use his [[The One True Hat]] to improve the fertility of the ground.
